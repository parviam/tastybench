<instructions>
Below is a transcript of someone deliberating between two projects. Your task is to identify which project they ended up reccomending. If they ended up reccomending Project 1, end your response with "PROJECT 1" and if they ended up reccomending Project 2, end your reponse with "PROJECT 2". If you don't know what project they reccomended, or it is otherwise unclear, write "UNCLEAR" and nothing else.

A researcher focused on maximizing citation velocity! I'll provide a clear recommendation based on the potential impact, novelty, and relevance of each project.

**Recommendation: Project 1 - Leveraging multi-agent reinforcement learning for collaborative problem solving**

Here's why:

1. **Novelty and Originality**: Project 1 explores a relatively new and uncharted territory in LLM research, combining multi-agent reinforcement learning with collaborative problem solving. This innovative approach is more likely to generate interest and excitement in the research community, leading to a higher citation velocity.
2. **Broader Applicability**: The multi-agent framework can be applied to various domains, including math, coding, and other areas where collaborative problem solving is essential. This broader applicability increases the project's potential impact and appeal to a wider audience.
3. **Interdisciplinary Connections**: Project 1 draws connections to multiple fields, such as multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, and natural language processing. This interdisciplinary nature can attract researchers from various backgrounds, leading to a more diverse and extensive citation network.
4. **Potential for Breakthroughs**: The collaborative problem-solving approach may lead to unexpected breakthroughs or insights, as the interactions between LLMs can uncover new patterns or strategies. Such breakthroughs can significantly boost citation velocity.
5. **Comparative Advantage**: While Project 2 focuses on a specific domain (financial reasoning), Project 1 offers a more generalizable framework that can be applied to various domains. This comparative advantage makes Project 1 more attractive for researchers seeking to explore new ideas and applications.

In contrast, Project 2, although well-defined and relevant to the financial domain, may be perceived as more incremental, as it builds upon existing techniques (supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning) and focuses on a specific application area.

To maximize citation velocity, consider the following strategies:

* Publish your work in a top-tier conference or journal to increase visibility and credibility.
* Share your code, data, and models to facilitate reproducibility and encourage other researchers to build upon your work.
* Engage with the research community through social media, blog posts, and presentations to promote your project and attract potential collaborators and citers.
* Explore opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations to expand your project's reach and impact.

By pursuing Project 1 and following these strategies, you can increase your chances of achieving a high citation velocity and establishing yourself as a leading researcher in the field of LLMs and reinforcement learning.
