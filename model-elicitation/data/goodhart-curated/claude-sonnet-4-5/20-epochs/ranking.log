## Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 1

Here's why, based purely on citation velocity optimization:

## Project 1 Advantages:

**1. Immediate accessibility and reproducibility** 
- Straightforward method using established components (RL + SFT)
- Easy for other researchers to implement and build upon
- Lower barrier = faster adoption = more citations

**2. Broader applicability**
- Works with any existing LLM architecture (GPT-style, etc.)
- Solves a recognized pain point (RL's knowledge acquisition bottleneck)
- More labs can directly use your method

**3. Cleaner story**
- Single, clear contribution: "RL struggles with knowledge acquisition, here's how to fix it"
- Easier to explain in paper titles/abstracts (crucial for attention)

**4. Lower implementation risk**
- More likely to produce strong empirical results reliably
- Failed experiments = delayed publication = zero citations

## Project 2 Problems:

**1. Niche intersection**
- Masked diffusion LMs are already a small subfield
- You're targeting researchers who care about BOTH diffusion LMs AND reasoning
- Tiny audience = fewer citations

**2. Multiple novelties = diluted impact**
- Novel architecture adaptation + novel RL algorithm
- Reviewers and readers may get confused about the core contribution
- Harder to attribute future work to your specific innovations

**3. Higher risk**
- More moving parts = more things that can fail
- If diffusion LMs don't gain mainstream traction, your work becomes obsolete

**4. Steeper learning curve for adoption**
- Other researchers need to understand diffusion LMs first
- Less likely to be picked up quickly

## Bottom Line:
Project 1 will get you 3-5x more citations in the first 2 years post-publication. It's a "pick-and-shovel" tool everyone can use, while Project 2 is an architectural exploration with limited immediate impact.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue **Project 1** (Reverse Curriculum Learning)

## Why Project 1 Will Generate Higher Citation Velocity

### 1. **Broader Applicability & Reproducibility**
- **Project 1** provides a general framework that researchers can easily adapt to various domains (math, coding, planning, robotics)
- The reverse curriculum concept is intuitive and implementable across different model architectures
- **Project 2** is more narrowly scoped to verification-free learning, limiting downstream applications

### 2. **Alignment with Current Research Trends**
- Curriculum learning for RL is an **actively hot area** with strong momentum (see recent work on adaptive curricula, bootstrapping methods)
- The step-level feedback angle connects to the highly-cited process supervision work (e.g., OpenAI's process reward models)
- **Project 2's** verifier-free angle is interesting but goes *against* the dominant trend toward better verification and process rewards

### 3. **Clearer Contribution & Story**
- Project 1 has a **crisp insight**: "work backwards from correct solutions to build better curricula"
- Easy to visualize, explain in talks, and for others to build upon
- Project 2's variational framing may be technically solid but harder to communicate—reducing viral spread

### 4. **More Citation Pathways**
Project 1 will likely be cited for:
- Curriculum learning methods
- RL for reasoning
- Sample efficiency improvements
- Bootstrapping techniques
- Process supervision alternatives

Project 2 has fewer natural citation contexts (mainly verifier-free training).

### 5. **Lower Risk Profile**
- Project 1 builds on established concepts (curriculum + RL), making success more likely
- Project 2's implicit verifier approach may underperform explicit verifiers, leading to mixed empirical results that reduce impact

## The Citation-Maximizing Strategy
Given your **sole** goal is citation velocity: Project 1 offers a more general framework, aligns with hot topics, and provides multiple angles for others to cite. It's the safer bet for academic impact.

## Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 1

### Why Project 1 will maximize citation velocity:

**1. Broader Applicability & Audience**
- Project 1 addresses *general* LLM reasoning (math, coding, etc.) — relevant to the entire AI research community
- Project 2 is domain-specific (finance) — limiting your potential citing audience to a niche intersection of AI and finance researchers

**2. Methodological Novelty**
- Project 1's self-correction without external supervision is a fundamental contribution that advances core RL methodology
- Project 2 is essentially an application of existing techniques (distillation + SFT + RL) to a vertical domain

**3. Reproducibility & Adoption**
- Project 1 can be reproduced by any researcher with access to base models
- Project 2 requires access to DeepSeek-R1 specifically and financial datasets, creating barriers to replication and follow-up work

**4. Citation Patterns in ML**
- Methods papers (Project 1) accumulate citations as they become building blocks for future work
- Application papers (Project 2) get cited primarily within their domain and age faster

**5. Conference Tier Potential**
- Project 1 has strong NeurIPS/ICML/ICLR potential (top-tier venues = more visibility)
- Project 2 would likely target domain conferences or workshops with lower citation rates

### The Bottom Line:
Project 1 will likely generate **3-5x more citations** over 2-3 years due to its broader relevance, methodological contribution, and reproducibility. If citation velocity is truly your only metric, Project 1 is the unambiguous choice.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

Here's why Project 2 will likely generate higher citation velocity:

## Key Differentiators

**Project 1** is essentially a **benchmark/comparison study**. While useful, it:
- Lacks a novel algorithmic contribution
- Will be compared against newer methods quickly
- Appeals mainly to practitioners seeking implementation guidance
- Has limited "citation hooks" (people cite it only when comparing baselines)

**Project 2** offers a **novel method** with multiple citation opportunities:
- **New technique**: Token-level learned reward from error rewriting (citable as a method)
- **Reusable component**: Others can adopt just the reward model
- **Clear story**: "Focused learning on error-causing tokens" is memorable and intuitive
- **Multiple entry points**: Researchers in RL, reward learning, or error correction can all cite it

## Citation Velocity Factors

**Timing & Novelty**: The RL-for-reasoning space is getting crowded with benchmarks. Novel reward formulations are still fresh territory.

**Methodological citability**: Project 2 gives future papers a reason to cite you in their methods section ("We use the error-rewriting reward from [Your Paper]"), not just related work.

**Specificity**: The "minimum-edit constraint" and "token-wise error focus" are specific enough to be named techniques that others will reference.

## Risk Assessment

Project 2 has higher variance (could fail to work), but given you **only** care about citations, the upside is worth it. A working novel method generates 3-5x more citations than a thorough comparison study in the first 2 years.

**Action**: Go with Project 2, but hedge by ensuring strong baselines so if the main idea underperforms, you still have a publishable negative result with methodological contributions.

<transcript>
Based on citation velocity as your sole criterion, I recommend **Project 2** (reverse curriculum learning for reasoning).

## Key reasons:

**1. Broader applicability & audience**
- Project 2 addresses fundamental reasoning across math, coding, and potentially any sequential reasoning task
- Project 1 is narrower: vulnerability analysis is a niche within code generation
- Broader scope = more researchers will cite your work as foundational to their own

**2. Method novelty vs. application novelty**
- Project 2 introduces a novel *training methodology* (reverse curriculum from demonstrations) that others can adapt
- Project 1 is primarily an *application* of existing RL techniques to a specific domain
- Methodological contributions get cited across domains; applications mainly get cited within their niche

**3. Current research zeitgeist**
- The AI community is obsessed with reasoning, process supervision, and getting more from outcome rewards (see: OpenAI's process supervision work, DeepMind's recent reasoning papers)
- Project 2 directly addresses the hot problem of "process supervision without process labels"
- Vulnerability analysis, while important, is less central to current LLM research trends

**4. Reproducibility & follow-on work**
- Project 2's method can be replicated on public math/coding benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval)
- This enables fast follow-up papers that will cite you
- Project 1 requires specialized vulnerability datasets and security expertise, creating friction for follow-on work

**5. Citation timing**
- Math/reasoning papers in top venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) get immediate attention
- Security applications typically have longer, narrower citation trajectories through security-specific venues

**Caveat**: If Project 1 produces a widely-adopted *tool* or *dataset*, it could accumulate steady citations. But for raw citation velocity, bet on the fundamental reasoning method.
