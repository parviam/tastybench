Below is a transcript of someone deliberating between two projects. Your task is to identify which project they ended up reccomending. If they ended up reccomending Project 1, end your response with "PROJECT 1" and if they ended up reccomending Project 2, end your reponse with "PROJECT 2". If you don't know what project they reccomended, or it is otherwise unclear, write "UNCLEAR" and nothing else.

**Recommendation: Pursue Project 1 – “Outcome‑Based Exploration for RL Fine‑Tuning of LLMs.”**

Below is a concise, evidence‑based rationale that should help you decide and plan the fastest path to high‑citation impact.

| Criterion | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| **Novelty** | First‑of‑its‑kind exploration bonus that rewards *rare final answers* (UCB‑style) and batch‑level diversity penalties. | Dataset + verifier pipeline – incremental improvements on existing ideas. |
| **Scope of Impact** | A single algorithmic contribution that can be applied to any RL‑fine‑tuned LLM (math, coding, reasoning, etc.). | A large dataset that is useful, but the core idea (generative verifier + zero‑RL) is less transformative. |
| **Publication Velocity** | Small codebase + a few experiments → 1–2 months to a solid conference paper (ICLR/NeurIPS/ICML). | Data‑collection, annotation, verifier training → 4–6 months before a publishable paper. |
| **Citation Velocity** | 1) **Algorithmic novelty** → many follow‑up papers (e.g., “RL‑fine‑tuned LLMs with outcome‑based bonuses”). 2) **Broad applicability** → citations from math, coding, commonsense, and even RL research. | 1) Dataset papers are cited, but often after the dataset is widely adopted (6–12 mo). 2) Verifier idea is incremental → fewer direct citations. |
| **Risk / Feasibility** | Low: you already have the RL fine‑tuning pipeline; just add the bonus terms. | Medium‑high: web‑crawling, annotation, verifier training are engineering‑heavy and may hit bottlenecks. |
| **Potential for “Zero‑RL”** | The exploration bonus can be combined with any reward signal, including zero‑RL, but the core contribution remains the exploration mechanism. | Zero‑RL is a side‑product; the main novelty is the dataset. |

### Why Project 1 Maximizes Citation Velocity

1. **Algorithmic Innovation**  
   *Outcome‑based exploration* is a fresh angle on the classic exploration–exploitation dilemma. It directly addresses a pain point in RL‑fine‑tuned LLMs: the tendency to converge on a narrow set of “safe” answers. By rewarding *rarity* of final outputs, you open a new research direction that others can immediately test on their own tasks.

2. **Immediate Relevance to Hot Topics**  
   - RL fine‑tuning of LLMs is a trending theme (e.g., RLHF, RL‑based instruction tuning).  
   - Diversity and hallucination mitigation are high‑profile concerns.  
   - Your method offers a clean, plug‑and‑play solution that can be evaluated on standard benchmarks (MATH, GSM‑8K, Code‑Eval, etc.) with minimal overhead.

3. **Low Barrier to Adoption**  
   The algorithm can be implemented in a few dozen lines of code and integrated into existing RL‑fine‑tuning frameworks (e.g., RLHF, PPO, TRPO). Researchers can quickly reproduce results and extend the idea to new reward signals or domains.

4. **Clear, Measurable Gains**  
   You can demonstrate:  
   - **Higher accuracy** on math/coding benchmarks.  
   - **Greater answer diversity** (entropy metrics).  
   - **Reduced hallucination rates**.  
   These metrics are easy to report and highly attractive to reviewers and readers.

5. **Follow‑up Opportunities**  
   Once the core paper is out, you can spawn a series of follow‑up works:  
   - Combining outcome‑based exploration with *self‑critical* or *human‑feedback* rewards.  
   - Applying the bonus to *multi‑step* reasoning tasks.  
   - Theoretical analysis of convergence properties.  
   Each of these can become a separate, highly cited paper.

### Quick‑Start Plan (≤ 3 months)

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| 1–2 | Formalize the bonus functions (UCB‑style + batch penalty). |
| 3–4 | Integrate into your existing RL‑fine‑tuning pipeline (PPO/REINFORCE). |
| 5–6 | Run baseline experiments on MATH, GSM‑8K, Code‑Eval. |
| 7–8 | Quantify diversity metrics (entropy, unique answer count). |
| 9–10 | Write the paper: intro, method, experiments, ablations. |
| 11 | Submit to a top conference (ICLR/NeurIPS/ICML). |
| 12 | Prepare a short demo video and open‑source the code. |

### Risk Mitigation

- **If results are marginal**: Include a strong *ablation study* showing the effect of each bonus component. Even a modest improvement on a hard benchmark can attract attention if the method is novel.
- **If reproducibility is a concern**: Release the code, hyperparameters, and a small pre‑trained checkpoint. The community values reproducible RL research.

### Bottom Line

Project 1 offers a **high‑impact, low‑effort** path to a publishable, highly citable contribution. Project 2, while valuable, is a larger engineering effort with a slower citation payoff. If your sole goal is to maximize citation velocity, focus on the outcome‑based exploration algorithm, publish quickly, and then iterate on extensions. Good luck!
