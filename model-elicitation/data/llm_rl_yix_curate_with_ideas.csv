dd4cfde3e135f799a9a71b4f57e13a29de89f7e3,"Inference scaling empowers LLMs with unprecedented reasoning ability, with reinforcement learning as the core technique to elicit complex reasoning. However, key technical details of state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are concealed (such as in OpenAI o1 blog and DeepSeek R1 technical report), thus the community still struggles to reproduce their RL training results. We propose the $\textbf{D}$ecoupled Clip and $\textbf{D}$ynamic s$\textbf{A}$mpling $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{DAPO}$) algorithm, and fully open-source a state-of-the-art large-scale RL system that achieves 50 points on AIME 2024 using Qwen2.5-32B base model. Unlike previous works that withhold training details, we introduce four key techniques of our algorithm that make large-scale LLM RL a success. In addition, we open-source our training code, which is built on the verl framework, along with a carefully curated and processed dataset. These components of our open-source system enhance reproducibility and support future research in large-scale LLM RL.",DAPO: An Open-Source LLM Reinforcement Learning System at Scale,"Decoupling the clipping operation from policy updates and introducing dynamic sampling of training data to adaptively focus on informative examples, DAPO optimizes large language models through reinforcement learning. By integrating these techniques into an open-source RL system built on the verl framework and providing a curated dataset, the approach enables scalable and reproducible training of high‑capacity LLMs for complex reasoning tasks."

Scaling reinforcement learning (RL) unlocks a new axis for the continued improvement of artificial intelligence, with the promise that large language models (LLMs) can scale their training data by learning to explore with rewards. However, prior published work has not produced competitive results. In light of this, we report on the training practice of Kimi k1.5, our latest multi-modal LLM trained with RL, including its RL training techniques, multi-modal data recipes, and infrastructure optimization. Long context scaling and improved policy optimization methods are key ingredients of our approach, which establishes a simplistic, effective RL framework without relying on more complex techniques such as Monte Carlo tree search, value functions, and process reward models. Notably, our system achieves state-of-the-art reasoning performance across multiple benchmarks and modalities -- e.g., 77.5 on AIME, 96.2 on MATH 500, 94-th percentile on Codeforces, 74.9 on MathVista -- matching OpenAI's o1. Moreover, we present effective long2short methods that use long-CoT techniques to improve short-CoT models, yielding state-of-the-art short-CoT reasoning results -- e.g., 60.8 on AIME, 94.6 on MATH500, 47.3 on LiveCodeBench -- outperforming existing short-CoT models such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 3.5 by a large margin (up to +550%).",Kimi k1.5: Scaling Reinforcement Learning with LLMs,"Training a multimodal large language model with reinforcement learning by leveraging long‑context scaling and enhanced policy optimization techniques, while deliberately omitting complex components such as Monte Carlo tree search, explicit value functions, and separate reward models. Incorporating a “long‑to‑short” transfer procedure that distills reasoning patterns from long chain‑of‑thought prompts into compact short‑CoT models, enabling effective reasoning across diverse modalities without additional reward modeling infrastructure."
c4ff8bc44d88cd267baf18ac5d3a3a1fe86d08eb,"Self-correction is a highly desirable capability of large language models (LLMs), yet it has consistently been found to be largely ineffective in modern LLMs. Current methods for training self-correction typically depend on either multiple models, a more advanced model, or additional forms of supervision. To address these shortcomings, we develop a multi-turn online reinforcement learning (RL) approach, SCoRe, that significantly improves an LLM's self-correction ability using entirely self-generated data. To build SCoRe, we first show that variants of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on offline model-generated correction traces are often insufficient for instilling self-correction behavior. In particular, we observe that training via SFT falls prey to either a distribution mismatch between mistakes made by the data-collection policy and the model's own responses, or to behavior collapse, where learning implicitly prefers only a certain mode of correction behavior that is often not effective at self-correction on test problems. SCoRe addresses these challenges by training under the model's own distribution of self-generated correction traces and using appropriate regularization to steer the learning process into learning a self-correction behavior that is effective at test time as opposed to fitting high-reward responses for a given prompt. This regularization process includes an initial phase of multi-turn RL on a base model to generate a policy initialization that is less susceptible to collapse, followed by using a reward bonus to amplify self-correction. With Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, we find that SCoRe achieves state-of-the-art self-correction performance, improving the base models' self-correction by 15.6% and 9.1% respectively on MATH and HumanEval.",Training Language Models to Self-Correct via Reinforcement Learning,"Developing a multi‑turn online reinforcement‑learning framework that trains a language model to self‑correct using only its own generated correction traces. The method first initializes a policy through multi‑turn RL to avoid behavior collapse, then applies regularized reward shaping—including a self‑correction bonus—to steer learning toward effective correction behavior under the model’s own distribution, eliminating the need for external supervision or multiple models."
