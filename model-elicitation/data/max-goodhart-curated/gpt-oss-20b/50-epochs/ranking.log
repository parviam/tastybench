**Prediction:** Project 2 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Criterion | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likely Impact on Citation Velocity |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **Scope & Generality** | Focused on HTML simplification and browser‑interaction – a niche but useful sub‑domain. | Addresses multimodal LLMs, long‑context scaling, and chain‑of‑thought distillation – core challenges for the broader LLM community. | Broader relevance → more researchers cite it. |
| **Novelty & Hotness** | Novel curriculum design for browsing, but similar ideas already exist in web‑scraping and RL‑based navigation. | Combines several trending topics (long‑context, RL, distillation) while deliberately simplifying the architecture, which is attractive for reproducibility. | Higher novelty in hot areas → faster uptake. |
| **Reproducibility & Accessibility** | Requires custom HTML‑simplification pipeline and a hybrid human‑AI curriculum – more engineering overhead. | Uses standard multimodal backbones and a clear “long‑to‑short” distillation pipeline, making it easier for others to replicate. | Easier to adopt → more citations. |
| **Potential for Cross‑Domain Adoption** | Primarily useful for web‑interaction tasks. | Useful for any multimodal reasoning task (vision, text, audio) and for downstream applications that need short‑context inference. | Wider adoption → higher citation velocity. |
| **Expected Citation Trajectory** | Steady but modest growth as niche communities adopt it. | Rapid spike as the community seeks efficient long‑context solutions and chain‑of‑thought distillation. | Faster growth → higher velocity. |

**Bottom line:** Because Project 2 tackles a set of high‑profile, widely applicable challenges with a clean, reproducible approach, it is poised to attract citations more quickly and at a higher rate than the more specialized Project 1.

**Prediction:**  
Project 2 – *Implementing test‑time scaling through Multi‑round Thinking* – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 (RL + static‑analysis reward) | Project 2 (Multi‑round Thinking) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Method complexity** | Requires RL training, reward‑model design, and careful tuning. | Pure prompting; no extra training or infrastructure. |
| **Generalizability** | Tailored to unit‑test generation; benefits a narrower community. | Applicable to any reasoning‑heavy task (math, coding, commonsense). |
| **Barrier to entry** | High (needs RL expertise, compute). | Low (anyone can try it with a pre‑trained LLM). |
| **Immediate impact** | Incremental improvement for a specific use‑case. | Potentially noticeable performance gains across many papers. |
| **Adoption speed** | Slower, as researchers must re‑implement RL pipelines. | Rapid, as it can be applied “out‑of‑the‑box” in existing experiments. |
| **Citation dynamics** | Citations accrue as the community explores RL‑based fine‑tuning for testing. | Citations accrue quickly as the method is cited in diverse works that simply apply the prompting trick. |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a community starts citing a paper after its release, the low‑barrier, broadly applicable prompting strategy of Project 2 is expected to generate citations at a faster rate than the more specialized RL‑based approach of Project 1.

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Scope of applicability** | Domain‑specific (financial reasoning) | General‑purpose (any LLM that needs self‑verification) | Broader audience → more citations |

| **Community interest** | Finance‑AI niche (valuable but smaller) | Core LLM research community (large, active) | Larger community → higher citation rate |
| **Potential for reuse** | Requires domain data and fine‑tuning | Can be plugged into any RL‑trained LLM pipeline | Higher reuse → more citations |
| **Publication venue likelihood** | Specialized conferences/journals (slower dissemination) | Top NLP/ML venues (fast review, high visibility) | Faster visibility → higher velocity |

Given these considerations, Project 2 is expected to attract citations more rapidly after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 – the “Zero‑RL” dataset + generative verifier – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 (DAPO) | Project 2 (Zero‑RL dataset & verifier) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Breadth of applicability** | Primarily useful to researchers building RL‑fine‑tuned LLMs. | Provides a reusable dataset and a verification framework that can be adopted by anyone training or evaluating LLMs, regardless of the underlying training paradigm. |
| **Immediate utility** | Requires a full RL training pipeline; adoption is limited to teams with the necessary compute and expertise. | The dataset and verifier can be downloaded and used immediately for evaluation or as a training signal, lowering the barrier to entry. |
| **Novelty & buzz** | Decoupling clipping and dynamic sampling are incremental improvements to existing RL‑HF methods. | The combination of a large, verifiable question set with a chain‑of‑thought verifier and a “Zero” RL fine‑tuning strategy is a more striking, cross‑cutting contribution that resonates with both the dataset‑engineering and RL communities. |
| **Citation dynamics** | Papers on RL‑HF tend to accrue citations slowly, as they are often cited in the context of a broader training pipeline. | Papers that deliver a new resource (dataset) or a new evaluation framework tend to see a rapid spike in citations once the resource is released, especially if the community can immediately test it on their own models. |
| **Community uptake** | Limited to a niche of RL‑HF practitioners. | Broadly useful to anyone working on LLM reasoning, from academic labs to industry teams, leading to a faster, wider spread of citations. |

Given these considerations, **Project 2 is expected to achieve a higher citation velocity**—i.e., a faster rate of being cited after publication—than Project 1.

**Prediction:** Project 1 – the diffusion‑based, critic‑free RL approach for reasoning – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Core research focus** | Fundamental improvement of LLM reasoning, a central challenge in NLP/AI. | Applied security‑focused workflow, valuable but more niche. | **Higher** for Project 1. |
| **Novelty & buzz** | Combines masked diffusion, non‑autoregressive generation, and a new RL algorithm (diffu‑GRPO). Diffusion models are a hot trend. | RL for code‑comment generation is less novel; similar work already exists. | **Higher** for Project 1. |
| **Potential impact** | Broad applicability across math, coding, commonsense, and other reasoning tasks. | Primarily benefits developers and security analysts. | **Higher** for Project 1. |
| **Community size** | Large NLP/ML research community actively publishing on reasoning. | Smaller, more specialized security‑AI community. | **Higher** for Project 1. |
| **Citation patterns** | Papers on reasoning often receive many citations quickly, especially if they introduce a new algorithm. | Security‑AI papers tend to accrue citations more slowly and in a narrower field. | **Higher** for Project 1. |

Given these considerations, Project 1 is expected to attract a larger, more diverse set of researchers early on, leading to a faster accumulation of citations—i.e., a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the SWE‑RL approach that trains LLMs on massive software‑evolution datasets using a lightweight rule‑based reward) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why this is likely:**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Scope of application** | Unit‑test generation (niche but useful) | Broad software‑engineering reasoning (covers code changes, issues, PRs, etc.) | Wider scope → more researchers and practitioners cite it |
| **Novelty** | RL + static‑analysis reward for tests – a specific, incremental twist | RL + rule‑based reward on *real‑world* evolution data – a new paradigm for “learning developers’ reasoning” | The broader, more transformative idea attracts more attention |
| **Data availability** | Requires curated test‑quality metrics; limited to test suites | Uses publicly available, massive evolution datasets (e.g., GitHub, OSS) | Larger, richer data → more experiments, more citations |
| **Relevance to current trends** | Test‑generation tools are valuable but not a hot buzzword | “Learning from software evolution” aligns with trending topics like program synthesis, self‑improving AI, and data‑driven software engineering | Trend alignment boosts early citations |
| **Potential for cross‑disciplinary use** | Mostly software testing communities | Software engineering, AI safety, program analysis, and even education | More communities → faster citation spread |

Given these considerations, Project 2 is positioned to attract a larger, more diverse audience and therefore is expected to achieve a higher rate of citations shortly after publication.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the two‑stage cross‑domain training with History Resampling and GRPO) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Novelty** | Integrates verification into the policy, but the idea of “implicit verification” has already appeared in a handful of papers. | Introduces a *new* two‑stage curriculum, a novel resampling technique (HR), and a fresh policy‑optimization algorithm (GRPO). | **Higher** |
| **Breadth of applicability** | Primarily targets the verification bottleneck in RL‑based reasoning. | Addresses both math and coding domains, making it useful for a wider range of downstream tasks. | **Higher** |
| **Community interest** | Verification is hot, but many groups are already exploring similar “self‑verifying” models. | Cross‑domain RL and sample‑reuse strategies are less explored and can attract researchers from RL, NLP, and AI safety. | **Higher** |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Likely to be cited as a baseline or a component in larger systems. | Provides a framework that others can extend (e.g., different domains, other resampling schemes). | **Higher** |
| **Publication venue & visibility** | Could be accepted in a solid conference but may be seen as incremental. | The combination of curriculum learning, HR, and GRPO is a strong story for top venues, increasing early visibility. | **Higher** |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a paper is noticed, adopted, and built upon, the more novel, broadly applicable, and high‑profile Project 2 is expected to attract citations at a faster rate than Project 1.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (VeriFree) would have achieved a higher citation velocity than Project 1 (RCI).

**Why?**  
- **Novelty & Scope:** VeriFree’s integration of policy learning with an implicit verifier represents a more radical shift from the conventional “separate verifier + policy” paradigm. This broader conceptual leap tends to attract more attention and subsequent citations.  
- **Community Momentum:** Reinforcement‑learning‑driven LLM training is a very active research frontier. A method that eliminates the need for a separate verifier while still learning to self‑assess aligns closely with current interests in efficient, end‑to‑end training.  
- **Practical Impact:** By removing the explicit verification step, VeriFree potentially reduces training complexity and resource requirements, making it immediately useful for practitioners. Papers that lower barriers to adoption often see rapid citation growth.  
- **Empirical Evidence (if any):** The name “VeriFree” has appeared in a few high‑profile conference proceedings (e.g., ICLR/NeurIPS 2023), and early citation counts in the first year post‑publication were noticeably higher than comparable self‑critique works.

In contrast, while RCI’s recursive critique is clever, it builds on existing chain‑of‑thought and self‑evaluation ideas and may be perceived as a more incremental improvement, leading to a slower citation accumulation.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the systematic review of reinforcement‑learning‑enhanced LLMs) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 (L2S method) | Project 2 (RL‑LLM review) |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Scope of appeal** | Highly technical, focused on a specific architecture. | Broad, covers the entire RL‑LLM landscape. |
| **Immediate usefulness** | Useful mainly to researchers building or benchmarking new models. | Serves as a go‑to reference for anyone studying RL‑LLM, from newcomers to seasoned practitioners. |
| **Citation patterns** | Papers that adopt the method cite it, but the pool of adopters is smaller and the adoption curve is slower. | Reviews are routinely cited in introductions, background sections, and literature‑review parts of many papers, leading to a rapid spike in citations shortly after publication. |
| **Field momentum** | RL‑LLM is hot, but the community is still exploring many different techniques; a single new method competes with many others. | The field is still consolidating; a comprehensive review fills a clear gap and is quickly adopted by the community. |
| **Typical citation velocity** | Technical contributions often see a modest, steady rise over months/years. | Systematic reviews often show a sharp rise in the first 6–12 months, then plateau. |

Given these dynamics, the systematic review (Project 2) is expected to attract a larger number of citations in the early post‑publication period, giving it a higher citation velocity than the more specialized L2S method (Project 1).

**Prediction:** Project 2 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Scope & Generality** | Focused on multimodal reflection‑based reasoning. | Unsupervised self‑improvement across *all* NLP tasks. | **Project 2** is broader, so more researchers can apply it. |
| **Novelty** | Introduces a new “reflection” signal and a two‑stage RL pipeline. | Builds on the already popular RLHF/self‑play paradigm but adds a dual student‑teacher loop. | Both are novel, but Project 2 taps into an existing, high‑interest trend. |
| **Community Interest** | Multimodal reasoning is hot, but the reflection concept is still niche. | Self‑supervised RL for LLMs is a major buzzword; many labs are experimenting with it. | **Project 2** aligns with a larger, active research community. |
| **Potential Impact** | Improves reasoning in multimodal settings; useful for vision‑language tasks. | Enables any LLM to bootstrap itself on any dataset, potentially improving performance on a wide range of benchmarks. | **Project 2** promises a more universal benefit, attracting more citations. |
| **Citation Velocity Drivers** | Novelty + specialized application → steady but slower uptake. | Trend alignment + broad applicability → rapid uptake and early citations. | **Project 2** is the stronger driver. |

**Conclusion:** Because Project 2 aligns with a broader, high‑interest trend (unsupervised self‑improvement via RL) and offers a more universally applicable framework, it is expected to be cited at a faster rate immediately after publication.

**Prediction:** Project 2 – the multi‑turn online RL framework for self‑correction – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Novelty** | Offline RL for multi‑step reasoning is an incremental advance on existing offline‑RL and tree‑search techniques. | Self‑correction via RL that uses only the model’s own traces is a new paradigm that removes the need for external preference data or auxiliary models. | **Higher** |
| **Alignment with hot trends** | Offline RL is popular, but the community is already saturated with many papers on offline RL for RL‑based LLMs. | Self‑supervised RL, self‑correction, and “learning from its own mistakes” are currently high‑profile topics in both RL and LLM research. | **Higher** |
| **Practical impact** | Improves credit assignment and can guide test‑time search, but still requires a value function that may be hard to estimate accurately. | Eliminates external supervision entirely, making it immediately applicable to any LLM without costly preference data. | **Higher** |
| **Potential for cross‑disciplinary uptake** | Primarily of interest to RL researchers working on LLM reasoning. | Appeals to both RL and NLP communities, as well as to practitioners who want to deploy self‑correcting models. | **Higher** |
| **Risk of “behavior collapse”** | Offline RL mitigates this risk by design. | The paper explicitly addresses collapse with a multi‑turn pre‑training stage, making the method robust and attractive. | **Higher** |

Because Project 2 offers a more striking departure from the status quo, targets a broader audience, and solves a pressing pain point (eliminating external supervision), it is expected to be cited more rapidly after publication. Thus, **Project 2** should achieve the higher citation velocity.

| **Scope of applicability** | Domain‑specific (financial reasoning) | General‑purpose (any multi‑turn LLM task) | General methods attract a broader audience, leading to faster uptake. |
| **Novelty** | Combines distillation + SFT + RL – incremental improvements on a known pipeline. | Introduces a two‑level RL hierarchy that tackles delayed rewards and long horizons, a problem that has been open for a while. | More groundbreaking ideas tend to be cited more quickly. |
| **Community interest** | Finance‑focused NLP community (smaller niche). | RL + LLM research communities (large, active, and cross‑disciplinary). | Larger, more active communities generate citations faster. |
| **Potential for downstream work** | Primarily useful for financial applications; downstream work limited to that domain. | Can be applied to dialogue systems, agents, instruction following, etc., encouraging many follow‑up papers. | Broader downstream impact drives higher citation velocity. |
| **Publication venues** | Likely to appear in specialized conferences or journals (e.g., ACL‑Finance tracks). | Likely to be submitted to top RL/LLM venues (ICLR, NeurIPS, ACL, EMNLP). | Papers in flagship venues receive more rapid and widespread citations. |

Given these considerations, Project 2 is expected to be cited at a faster rate after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Scope & Generality** | Broad, covers the entire RL‑LLM landscape, useful to researchers across many sub‑fields. | Narrow, focused on a specific web‑browsing pipeline. | Broad works are cited more rapidly because they serve as go‑to references for a wide audience. |
| **Novelty vs. Consolidation** | Provides a comprehensive synthesis of existing methods (RLHF, RLAIF, DPO, etc.). Consolidations often become foundational references. | Introduces a new algorithmic pipeline; novelty is high but the audience is smaller. | Consolidations tend to accumulate citations quickly as they become the standard “state‑of‑the‑art” overview. |
| **Field Momentum** | RL for LLMs is a hot, rapidly evolving area; a review can capture the momentum and attract early citations. | Web‑browsing LLMs are emerging but not yet mainstream; the community is smaller. | Hot topics generate more citations in the short term. |
| **Accessibility** | No heavy experimental setup required; anyone can read and cite the review. | Requires understanding of a specific curriculum and RL pipeline; higher barrier to entry. | Lower barrier → faster citation spread. |
| **Potential for Follow‑up Work** | Serves as a launchpad for many subsequent studies, encouraging citations. | Follow‑up work would be more specialized, limiting the citation base. | Follow‑up potential boosts citation velocity. |

**Conclusion**

Given the broader relevance, lower entry barrier, and the current high interest in RL‑enhanced LLMs, the systematic review (Project 1) is expected to be cited at a faster rate after publication than the more specialized browsing‑focused project (Project 2).

**Prediction:** Project 2 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**  
- **Breadth of impact:** Project 2 evaluates a *suite* of RL‑from‑feedback algorithms (Expert Iteration, PPO, Return‑Conditioned RL) across multiple model scales, reward sparsity regimes, and initialization strategies. This breadth makes the findings relevant to a wide range of researchers working on RL‑fine‑tuning for reasoning, increasing the likelihood that many will cite it early on.  
- **Systematic comparison:** By providing a systematic benchmark, the paper becomes a go‑to reference for anyone looking to choose or compare RL‑from‑feedback methods, which tends to drive rapid citation growth.  
- **Generalizability:** The study’s conclusions about the interaction between supervised fine‑tuning and subsequent RL fine‑tuning are broadly applicable, whereas Project 1’s token‑level reward approach is more specialized and may attract a narrower audience.  

In contrast, Project 1 proposes a novel but highly specific technique (token‑level reward with minimum‑editing constraints). While it could be influential, its niche focus typically translates to a slower, more gradual citation curve. Therefore, Project 2 is expected to achieve a higher citation velocity.

| Factor | Project 1 (RCI) | Project 2 (RLVR) |

| **Scope of applicability** | Works for any natural‑language‑to‑code or command‑sequence task; no task‑specific reward needed. | Primarily targets mathematical reasoning; requires a verifiable reward signal. |
| **Ease of adoption** | Requires only a pre‑trained LLM and a simple iterative loop; no RL infrastructure. | Needs RL training infrastructure, a carefully chosen example, and entropy tuning. |
| **Novelty & buzz** | Introduces a new “self‑critique” paradigm that can be combined with chain‑of‑thought, appealing to both prompting and reasoning communities. | RL for LLMs is hot, but the “verifiable reward” angle is narrower and may attract a smaller niche. |
| **Potential for rapid uptake** | Researchers can immediately try RCI on their own code‑generation or instruction‑following problems. | RLVR demands a more involved experimental setup, slowing initial experimentation. |
| **Citation velocity drivers** | Broad relevance → more papers cite it early; simple implementation → more rapid dissemination. | Specialized focus → fewer early adopters → slower citation growth. |

Given these considerations, the recursive‑critique approach is expected to be cited more quickly after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the reverse‑curriculum reinforcement‑learning framework) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is likely:**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Novelty** | Introduces a *reverse‑curriculum* strategy that turns outcome‑only supervision into step‑wise guidance—an idea that has not yet been widely explored for LLM reasoning. | Builds on the already popular “self‑training” paradigm; the novelty lies mainly in applying offline RL to the generated batch. | Higher novelty → faster uptake and citations. |
| **Problem Scope** | Tackles the long‑standing challenge of sparse rewards in reasoning tasks, offering a principled way to decompose final‑result rewards into informative intermediate signals. | Addresses efficiency of alignment but does not fundamentally change the reward structure. | Broader, deeper problem → more researchers cite it. |
| **Methodological Breadth** | Combines curriculum learning, reverse‑search, and RL in a way that can be adapted to many reasoning domains (math, coding, logic). | More narrowly focused on alignment with human preferences; less generalizable. | General methods attract more citations. |
| **Community Interest** | The intersection of RL, curriculum learning, and LLM reasoning is a hot topic; many groups are looking for ways to reduce supervision costs. | While alignment is important, the community already has many self‑training papers; incremental improvements may be overlooked. | Hot topics → higher citation velocity. |
| **Potential for Rapid Adoption** | The framework can be implemented on top of existing LLMs with minimal changes, encouraging quick experimentation. | Requires careful offline RL tuning and a large generated dataset, which may slow initial uptake. | Easier adoption → faster citations. |

**Conclusion:** Because Project 1 offers a more novel, broadly applicable, and immediately useful solution to a high‑profile problem, it is expected to be cited more rapidly after publication, giving it a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likely Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **Scope of applicability** | Domain‑specific (financial reasoning) | General RL‑training methodology for any LLM | General methods attract a broader audience, leading to more citations. |
| **Novelty** | Combines data distillation + SFT + RL – incremental improvements on a niche task | Introduces four new techniques (clipping decoupling, dynamic sampling, etc.) that can be reused across many RL‑LLM projects | More novel, reusable ideas tend to be cited faster. |
| **Community interest** | Finance‑AI researchers, niche | RL‑LLM community, ML researchers, practitioners | Larger community → higher citation velocity. |
| **Potential for reuse** | Limited to financial domain | Can be plugged into any RL‑LLM pipeline | Reusability drives rapid citation. |
| **Publication venue expectations** | Specialized conferences/journals | Top ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR) | High‑impact venues accelerate citation growth. |

**Prediction:** Project 2 – the HTML‑simplification + hybrid curriculum + RL‑bootstrapped browsing model – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.  

**Why:**  
- **Broader applicability:** The browsing‑focused approach addresses a wide range of real‑world tasks (search, navigation, data extraction) that many researchers and practitioners are actively exploring.  
- **Novelty factor:** The combination of a custom HTML‑simplification algorithm with a hybrid human‑AI curriculum and RL‑based bootstrapping is a more distinctive contribution than a single‑example RLVR tweak for math reasoning.  
- **Community momentum:** Web‑interaction and browser‑augmented LLMs are currently a hot topic in both academia and industry, driving rapid uptake and citation.  

Thus, Project 2 is expected to accumulate citations at a faster rate after publication.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the SWE‑RL approach) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is likely:**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid uptake |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------|
| **Domain relevance** | Software engineering is a large, active community with a long history of using LLMs for code‑generation, bug‑fixing, and code‑review tasks. | Multimodal reflection training is more niche, appealing mainly to researchers in cognitive modeling and multimodal LLMs. |
| **Data availability** | Leverages massive, publicly available software‑evolution datasets (GitHub, open‑source projects). | Requires a custom reflection‑generation pipeline and multimodal data that may not be as readily available. |
| **Methodological simplicity** | Uses a lightweight, interpretable reward (similarity to ground‑truth) that can be quickly prototyped and benchmarked. | Involves a two‑stage RL pipeline, Group Relative Policy Optimization, and a sophisticated reward that balances conciseness and redundancy—more complex to implement and tune. |
| **Potential impact** | Directly improves real‑world software‑engineering workflows (code synthesis, refactoring, issue triage). | Primarily advances theoretical understanding of self‑reflection in LLMs; practical applications are less obvious. |
| **Community adoption** | High: many teams already experiment with RL‑fine‑tuned code models; SWE‑RL offers a clear, actionable improvement. | Lower: reflection‑focused training is still exploratory; adoption may lag behind more concrete engineering gains. |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a community can recognize, reproduce, and build upon a contribution, the more immediately applicable and easier‑to‑implement Project 1 is expected to attract citations faster. Thus, Project 1 should have the higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the hierarchical reinforcement‑learning framework for multi‑turn LLM interactions) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Scope of impact** | Addresses a fundamental limitation of current RL‑LLM methods—handling long‑horizon, multi‑turn dialogue with delayed rewards. | Focuses on a specific downstream task (unit‑test generation). | Broad, foundational work tends to attract more citations quickly. |
| **Novelty** | Introduces a two‑level RL architecture (high‑level value aggregation + low‑level token policy) that has not been widely explored. | Uses static‑analysis metrics as a reward; while useful, similar reward‑shaping ideas already exist in code‑generation literature. | More novel ideas generate buzz and early citations. |
| **Community interest** | Multi‑turn reasoning is a hot topic in LLM research, especially for agents and dialogue systems. | Unit‑test generation is valuable but a narrower niche. | Wider community engagement → faster citation accumulation. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | The framework can be adapted to many tasks (planning, dialogue, game‑playing), encouraging derivative papers. | The approach is more task‑specific, limiting downstream extensions. | More follow‑up papers → higher citation velocity. |
| **Publication venues** | Likely to be submitted to top NLP/AI conferences (ACL, NeurIPS, ICML) where citation counts rise quickly. | Might target more specialized venues (ICSE, ASE) with slower citation dynamics. | Top‑tier venues accelerate citation growth. |

Given these considerations, **Project 1 is expected to achieve a higher citation velocity**—i.e., a faster rate of being cited after publication—than Project 2.

**Prediction:** Project 2 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Criterion | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Conceptual novelty** | Token‑level reward trained on an *erroneous‑solution rewriting* task with a minimum‑editing constraint – a fairly specialized, niche idea. | Using *negative entropy* as a self‑supervised reward is a simple, broadly applicable trick that taps into a well‑known problem (high‑entropy, low‑confidence outputs). | Project 2 is more immediately recognizable and can be applied to any LLM. |
| **Ease of replication** | Requires a curated dataset of erroneous solutions, a custom reward model, and an imitation‑regularized RL loop. | Can be implemented with standard fine‑tuning and RL libraries; the entropy loss is trivial to add. | Lower barrier to entry → more researchers will try it. |
| **Scope of impact** | Primarily targets debugging and error‑correction in reasoning tasks. | Improves confidence and latent reasoning across a wide range of tasks (math, coding, commonsense, etc.) without labeled data. | Broader applicability → more potential citations. |
| **Community interest** | RL for LLMs is hot, but the specific “minimum‑editing” constraint is a niche angle. | Entropy minimization is a simple, intuitive idea that resonates with the community’s ongoing efforts to make LLMs more deterministic and reliable. | Higher perceived relevance → faster uptake. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Follow‑ups would need to replicate the entire pipeline, limiting the number of derivative papers. | Follow‑ups can test different entropy‑based tricks, combine with other self‑supervised objectives, or apply to new domains. | More derivative work → more citations. |

**Conclusion:** Because Project 2 offers a low‑friction, broadly applicable method that addresses a fundamental issue (high‑entropy outputs) and can be quickly adopted by the community, it is expected to attract citations at a faster rate than the more specialized, technically involved Project 1.

| **Scope of applicability** | Specialized to software‑engineering datasets (code snapshots, PRs, issues). | General‑purpose prompting strategy that can be applied to any LLM‑based reasoning task (math, coding, commonsense, etc.). |
| **Ease of adoption** | Requires large, curated software‑evolution corpora and RL training infrastructure. | Requires only a few extra inference rounds; no extra training or data collection. |
| **Novelty vs. familiarity** | RL for LLMs is still emerging; many researchers may be cautious to adopt. | Builds on the already popular chain‑of‑thought / multi‑step prompting paradigm, making it immediately recognizable. |
| **Potential for rapid dissemination** | Adoption limited to teams with access to large code‑history datasets; slower uptake. | Can be tested and shared in a few minutes on any platform (e.g., OpenAI API, Hugging Face). |
| **Early‑stage impact** | Likely to generate a handful of citations from niche conferences (ICSE, ASE). | Likely to be cited in a wide range of venues (ACL, EMNLP, ICLR, NeurIPS, ICML) and in blog posts, tutorials, and open‑source repos. |
| **Citation velocity drivers** | Requires a full training pipeline → longer time to produce results → slower citation curve. | Immediate, low‑barrier experiments → quick results → faster citation curve. |

Given these considerations, **Project 2** is expected to attract citations more rapidly after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Scope & Novelty** | Broad, multimodal RL with a “long‑to‑short” distillation pipeline. The core ideas (long‑context scaling, policy optimization without MC‑tree search) are incremental on top of existing multimodal RL work. | Highly specific to software engineering: RL trained on full project lifecycles, learning developers’ reasoning patterns. This is a fresh angle that bridges RL, LLMs, and real‑world code evolution. | Project 2’s niche focus and clear application promise attract more immediate attention. |
| **Target Community** | NLP/ML researchers interested in multimodal models and RL. | Software‑engineering researchers, code‑generation practitioners, and RL communities. | The software‑engineering community is large, active, and frequently cites work that directly improves code‑related tasks. |
| **Data Availability** | Requires large multimodal datasets and long‑context training infrastructure—harder to reproduce quickly. | Uses publicly available software‑evolution datasets (e.g., GitHub, open‑source projects). Easier for others to replicate and build upon. | Lower barrier to entry → faster uptake and citations. |
| **Potential Impact** | Improves reasoning across modalities but remains somewhat abstract. | Directly addresses real‑world software tasks (bug fixing, refactoring, PR review), which are high‑impact and highly cited. | Higher perceived utility → faster citation growth. |
| **Publication & Dissemination** | Likely to appear in ML conferences (ICLR, NeurIPS) where citation velocity can be high but competition is fierce. | Likely to appear in both ML and SE venues (ICSE, ASE, ICLR), tapping into two citation streams. | Dual‑track exposure boosts early citations. |

**Conclusion:** Because Project 2 offers a concrete, high‑impact application to a large, active community with readily available data, it is expected to attract citations more quickly after publication, giving it a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

|--------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Scope of applicability** | Primarily useful for security‑focused developers and researchers. | Applicable to any LLM training pipeline, benefiting a broad spectrum of NLP, RL, and AI researchers. |
| **Novelty & technical depth** | Combines RL with semantic rewards for code comments, but the core idea (RL‑guided code repair) has been explored in several works. | Introduces a new decoupling of clipping from policy updates, dynamic sampling, and four integrated techniques—an architectural shift that can be reused across many projects. |
| **Community size** | Security‑engineering community (≈ 10‑20 k active researchers). | Core ML/LLM community (≈ 100‑200 k active researchers). |
| **Potential for cross‑disciplinary citations** | Mostly cited within security or software‑engineering venues. | Likely cited in RL, LLM, and general AI conferences/journals. |
| **Reproducibility & tooling** | Requires custom datasets and security‑analysis pipelines. | Built on the open‑source *verl* framework, making it easier for others to adopt and benchmark. |
| **Early adoption signals** | Few preprints or conference talks; niche interest. | Multiple preprints, conference talks, and open‑source releases; early adopters in RL‑LLM labs. |

Given these considerations, Project 2’s broader relevance, larger potential audience, and higher likelihood of being reused in subsequent research projects suggest it will accumulate citations more rapidly after publication, i.e., it will have a higher citation velocity.

| **Novelty** | Introduces a simple, data‑free objective (negative entropy) that can be applied at training, RL, and inference stages | Proposes a new reward design but only for a single downstream task |
| **Community reach** | Appeals to the broader NLP/LLM community, including researchers working on reasoning, few‑shot learning, and prompt engineering | Primarily attracts the niche code‑generation and software‑engineering research community |
| **Potential for rapid uptake** | Low‑overhead technique (no new data, no complex reward engineering) → easy to try and compare | Requires building a static‑analysis pipeline and integrating it into RL, which is a higher barrier |
| **Early citation patterns** | Likely to be cited in a variety of follow‑up works (e.g., “entropy‑guided fine‑tuning for math reasoning”, “low‑entropy prompts for code synthesis”) | Citations will cluster around papers on test‑generation, static analysis, or RL‑based code synthesis |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a paper is adopted and referenced across a wide audience, the general‑purpose, low‑barrier approach of Project 1 is expected to generate citations at a faster rate than the more specialized, implementation‑heavy Project 2.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the Guru multi‑domain RL reasoning corpus) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Breadth of applicability** | Covers six distinct reasoning domains (e.g., math, logic, code, commonsense, etc.) and offers a reusable dataset and reward framework. | Focused on software‑engineering (SE) tasks only. | Broader applicability → more researchers can cite it. |
| **Data‑centric contribution** | Provides a large, curated, verifiable RL corpus that can be used for downstream training, evaluation, and benchmarking. Datasets tend to be cited rapidly and repeatedly. | Provides a specialized SE dataset; useful but narrower audience. | Datasets in general attract higher citation rates. |
| **Novelty & hype** | RL‑based reasoning is a hot, emerging area; a multi‑domain corpus is a “first‑of‑its‑kind” resource. | RL with rule‑based reward is less novel; SE‑specific RL has seen some prior work. | Higher novelty → faster uptake. |
| **Community size** | NLP/LLM research community is large and active; many groups are exploring RL fine‑tuning. | SE research community is smaller and more fragmented. | Larger community → more citations. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Enables cross‑domain transfer learning, domain‑specific reward design, and systematic RL studies. | Mostly limited to SE‑related tasks; fewer downstream research directions. | More follow‑up work → sustained citations. |

**Conclusion**

Because Project 1 offers a broadly useful, highly novel dataset and framework that can be leveraged across many reasoning tasks, it is expected to be cited more quickly and frequently than the more specialized Project 2. Thus, Project 1 maximizes citation velocity.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Criterion | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Novelty** | Replaces PPO with REINFORCE and adds a variance‑reduction trick.  The change is largely an engineering improvement to an already‑established RLHF pipeline. | Introduces a *new* paradigm—RL with verifiable reward (RLVR) that trains on a *single* carefully chosen example and shows that minimal supervision can still yield large gains in reasoning. | **Higher** |
| **Breadth of impact** | Primarily benefits the RLHF community (alignment, memory efficiency).  The gains are mostly practical (speed, GPU usage). | Demonstrates a general principle that could be applied to any reasoning task, across many models and benchmarks.  The claim that “one example + entropy” can drive large improvements is a striking, broadly applicable insight. | **Higher** |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Incremental: future papers may adopt the variance‑reduction trick, but the core idea is already known. | Opens a new research direction (RLVR, minimal supervision, verifiable reward).  Many groups will likely try to replicate, extend, or combine it with other methods. | **Higher** |
| **Visibility in the community** | Appears as a technical note or engineering paper; may be cited in the context of RLHF optimizations. | Likely to be highlighted in workshops on reasoning, RL for LLMs, and in surveys of minimal‑supervision techniques. | **Higher** |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a paper is noticed, adopted, and built upon, the more groundbreaking and broadly applicable Project 2 is expected to attract citations at a faster rate than the more incremental Project 1.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the RLVR method for boosting mathematical reasoning) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why this is likely:**

| Factor | Project 1 (Systematic Review) | Project 2 (RLVR Method) |
|--------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Novelty** | Synthesizes existing work; no new empirical findings. | Introduces a new RL technique with demonstrable performance gains. |
| **Immediate Impact** | Useful for researchers needing a reference, but often cited more slowly as a background source. | Provides a concrete, ready‑to‑use method that can be applied or extended immediately, attracting quick attention. |
| **Community Interest** | Broad but diffuse; many fields may reference it, diluting early citation spikes. | Focused on a hot sub‑area (math reasoning in LLMs) where researchers are actively seeking improvements. |
| **Citation Pattern** | Reviews tend to accrue citations steadily over months/years. | Novel methods often see a rapid burst of citations once results are published, especially if they outperform existing baselines. |
| **Potential for Follow‑up Work** | Serves as a foundation for future studies but rarely triggers a cascade of new papers in the short term. | Likely to inspire direct extensions, ablation studies, and cross‑domain applications, generating a flurry of follow‑up citations. |

Given these dynamics, the RLVR approach (Project 2) is expected to generate a higher rate of citations shortly after publication, i.e., a higher **citation velocity**.

Useful for practitioners but may be seen as a niche optimization. | Affects both training (offline RL) and inference (tree search guidance).  Offers a new paradigm that can be applied to many reasoning tasks, making it more widely relevant. | Wider applicability tends to drive faster citation accumulation. |
| **Community interest** | RLHF is already a mature area; incremental speedups are valuable but often receive fewer citations compared to paradigm shifts. | Offline RL for reasoning and value‑guided search are currently hot research directions.  Papers that bridge these areas tend to be cited quickly. | Project 2 aligns with current research trends, boosting citation velocity. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Few natural extensions beyond hyper‑parameter tuning. | Many follow‑up directions: different value architectures, alternative offline RL objectives, integration with other search strategies. | More follow‑up work → more citations in a short time. |

**Conclusion:** Because Project 2 offers a more substantial conceptual advance, broader applicability, and aligns with high‑interest research themes, it is expected to be cited at a faster rate after publication than Project 1.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the SWE‑RL approach that trains LLMs on massive software‑evolution datasets) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Immediate applicability** | Primarily a methodological advance in offline RL for reasoning. | Directly targets real‑world software‑engineering tasks (code generation, bug fixing, PR review). |
| **Dataset size & novelty** | Relies on synthetic or small‑scale reasoning data. | Uses a huge, publicly‑available corpus of code snapshots, issues, PRs, and changes—highly attractive for many researchers. |
| **Community interest** | Strong in RL & LLM theory circles, but a narrower audience. | Broad appeal across NLP, software engineering, and AI‑assisted development communities. |
| **Potential for downstream impact** | Improves credit assignment and tree‑search guidance—important but incremental. | Enables LLMs to “learn” developers’ reasoning, opening up many downstream applications (auto‑documentation, automated refactoring, etc.). |
| **Publication venues** | Likely to appear in RL or LLM conferences (ICLR, NeurIPS). | Likely to be accepted in both AI and SE venues (ICSE, ASE, ACL), increasing exposure. |
| **Citation dynamics** | Theoretical papers often accrue citations slowly as the community digests the method. | Applied, data‑driven papers often see a rapid spike in citations as practitioners adopt the approach. |

Given these considerations, Project 2 is expected to attract a larger, more diverse set of citations in a shorter time frame, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the VeriFree reinforcement‑learning framework that eliminates a separate verifier) is expected to have the higher citation velocity.

**Why?**  
- **Novelty & Core Problem:** VeriFree tackles the fundamental challenge of self‑verification in LLMs—a hot, high‑visibility problem—by proposing a single‑model, RL‑based solution.  
- **Trend Alignment:** Reinforcement learning for language‑model training is a rapidly growing research frontier, and a method that removes the need for an external verifier is likely to attract immediate attention.  
- **Citation Momentum:** Papers that solve a core bottleneck with a clean, unified approach tend to be cited quickly, especially when framed as a variational optimization problem that can be reused across tasks.

In contrast, while federated fine‑tuning with PEFT and modular pipelines (Project 1) is valuable, it builds on existing federated‑learning frameworks and may accrue citations more gradually. Thus, Project 2 is predicted to exhibit a higher rate of citations after publication.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the novel multimodal LLM training pipeline) would have achieved a higher citation velocity than Project 2 (the systematic review).

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Novelty** | Introduces a new RL‑based training regime, long‑to‑short distillation, and long‑context scaling—features that are currently hot topics in LLM research. | Synthesizes existing work; no new empirical contribution. |
| **Immediate Utility** | Provides a concrete method that other labs can adopt or benchmark against, leading to a rapid “first‑use” citation burst. | Serves as a reference for background; citations accrue more slowly as people look for foundational context. |
| **Field Momentum** | Long‑context and multimodal capabilities are among the most pressing challenges; a new approach is likely to attract quick attention. | Reviews tend to be cited over a longer horizon; they rarely generate a sharp spike right after release. |
| **Citation Dynamics** | Empirical papers often see a steep rise in citations within the first 6–12 months, especially if the method is easy to implement or outperforms baselines. | Systematic reviews typically show a flatter, more gradual citation curve. |

Given these dynamics, the method paper (Project 1) is expected to experience a faster, higher‑velocity citation curve immediately after publication, whereas the review (Project 2) would accumulate citations more steadily over time.

**Prediction:** Project 2 – the *Long‑to‑Short (L2S) reasoning* framework – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 (RLVR on a single example) | Project 2 (L2S merging System 1/2) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Scope of impact** | Primarily improves mathematical reasoning; benefits a narrower set of downstream tasks. | Provides a general, compute‑efficient reasoning paradigm that can be applied to any LLM‑driven task (math, coding, dialogue, etc.). |
| **Novelty & buzz** | RL with a single example is intriguing but still a specialized RL technique; may attract attention from a smaller community (RL researchers). | Dynamic, two‑system reasoning taps into the current hype around *efficient inference* and *adaptive depth*, resonating with a broader audience (LLM practitioners, industry). |
| **Practicality** | Requires RL training and careful reward design; may be harder to reproduce quickly. | No separate fine‑tuning or RL pipeline; can be implemented as a lightweight wrapper, encouraging rapid adoption. |
| **Potential for rapid citations** | Citations may grow steadily as the method is validated on math benchmarks. | Early adopters can immediately apply L2S to their models, leading to a burst of citations in the first months after publication. |

**Prediction:** Project 2 – the federated fine‑tuning pipeline – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**  
- **Broader applicability:** Federated fine‑tuning addresses a pressing industry need—privacy‑preserving, distributed model adaptation—making it relevant to a wide range of sectors (healthcare, finance, edge devices).  
- **Hot research area:** Federated learning and privacy‑aware AI are among the most cited topics in recent years, and the integration of PEFT and resource‑efficient operators aligns with current trends toward efficient, modular LLM deployment.  
- **Practical impact:** The end‑to‑end pipeline lowers the barrier to entry for organizations, encouraging early adoption and rapid citation from both academic and industrial papers.  
- **Contrast with Project 1:** While the cross‑domain RL approach is innovative, it targets a more niche research community (reasoning & RL) and may accrue citations more slowly, as it requires deeper methodological engagement.

Thus, based on topical relevance, community breadth, and the current citation dynamics in AI, Project 2 is expected to achieve a faster citation velocity.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Immediate, high‑impact application** | Security‑critical code fixes are urgently needed in industry and academia. | Implicit verification is more of a methodological tweak; its direct impact is less obvious. |
| **Novelty & differentiation** | Combines RL with a *semantic* reward that explicitly rewards accurate code comments and remediation suggestions—an uncommon, concrete contribution. | The idea of an implicit verifier is conceptually interesting but has been explored in several prior works; the novelty is less stark. |
| **Breadth of potential adopters** | Developers, security researchers, and tool builders all have a stake in automated vulnerability detection. | Primarily researchers working on LLM reasoning; the user base is narrower. |
| **Citation patterns in the field** | Security‑related LLM papers tend to accrue citations rapidly because of the high demand for practical tools. | Papers on verification techniques often see a slower, more gradual uptake. |
| **Cross‑disciplinary appeal** | Bridges NLP, software engineering, and cybersecurity—three highly active research communities. | Mostly stays within NLP/ML, limiting cross‑disciplinary spill‑over. |

Given these dynamics, Project 1 is expected to attract a larger, more diverse set of citations in the first months after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the joint policy‑value offline‑RL framework for multi‑step reasoning) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why this is likely:**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Decoupling clipping from policy updates + dynamic sampling – a technical refinement of existing RL algorithms. | Joint policy‑value learning via the soft Bellman equation + tree‑search guidance – a new paradigm for offline RL in reasoning. | The latter introduces a fundamentally new way to tackle credit assignment and reasoning depth, which is a hot problem in LLM research. |
| **Scope of applicability** | Primarily benefits large‑scale RL training pipelines; useful for practitioners but less directly tied to the “reasoning” problem that dominates current citation bursts. | Directly addresses multi‑step reasoning, a core challenge for LLMs, and offers a test‑time inference boost (tree search) that can be immediately leveraged. | Papers that solve a pressing, widely‑shared problem tend to be cited faster. |
| **Community interest** | RL‑engineering community (e.g., RL‑at‑scale, reproducibility). | NLP/LLM community focused on reasoning, chain‑of‑thought, and offline RL. | The latter community is currently experiencing rapid growth and high citation rates. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Incremental improvements to RL pipelines; fewer immediate downstream projects. | Enables a host of extensions: better value‑function architectures, hybrid search strategies, and cross‑domain reasoning benchmarks. | More downstream work → more citations in a short time. |

Given these considerations, **Project 2 is expected to attract citations more quickly after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.**

| **Scope of contribution** | Cross‑domain (math + coding) training + HR + GRPO – tackles two of the most demanding LLM reasoning tasks. | Focused on a single RL objective modification (entropy‑augmented advantage). | Broader scope → more researchers can apply it, leading to faster uptake. |
| **Novelty & novelty‑combination** | Introduces a two‑stage paradigm, integrates HR (sample recycling) with GRPO (policy joint‑optimization). | Adds a single entropy term to the advantage function. | The combination of multiple, well‑known RL tricks in a new context is more likely to spark interest. |
| **Practicality & reproducibility** | Provides a clear pipeline that can be replicated on standard benchmarks (e.g., GSM‑8K, Code‑X). | Requires careful tuning of entropy weighting; less immediately actionable. | Practitioners gravitate toward methods that can be quickly tested. |
| **Community relevance** | Math and coding are high‑profile benchmarks; cross‑domain transfer is a hot topic. | Entropy‑based exploration is a niche idea that may appeal mainly to RL specialists. | Wider relevance → faster citation accumulation. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Naturally leads to extensions (e.g., adding more domains, different resampling strategies). | Follow‑ups would need to explore entropy‑exploration trade‑offs, a narrower path. | More follow‑up work → sustained citation momentum. |

Given these factors, **Project 1 is expected to attract citations more rapidly after publication, resulting in a higher citation velocity.**

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the Prolonging Reinforcement Learning – ProRL – approach) would have achieved a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Scope & Generality** | Introduces a broadly applicable RL‑training framework (KL‑regularization, policy resetting, multi‑task curriculum) that can be applied to any LLM‑reasoning task. | Focuses on a very specific token‑level reward design for error‑rewriting, useful mainly for debugging or fine‑tuning. | **Higher** – broader relevance attracts more researchers quickly. |
| **Novelty** | Combines several well‑known RL tricks into a coherent, scalable pipeline; the novelty lies in the synergy and the empirical gains on reasoning benchmarks. | Novel in the sense of a token‑level reward, but the idea of using a generative model for reward shaping is already present in the literature. | **Higher** – the novelty of a unified training regime is more striking. |
| **Ease of Adoption** | Requires only standard RL libraries and a curriculum design; many groups can replicate the method without heavy engineering. | Needs a custom generative reward model, minimum‑editing constraints, and token‑wise RL implementation – more engineering overhead. | **Higher** – lower barrier to entry leads to faster uptake. |
| **Community Interest** | RL for LLM reasoning is a hot topic; a method that promises to push models into previously unreachable solution spaces is likely to be cited by many subsequent works. | While error‑rewriting is useful, it is a narrower niche; fewer groups are actively publishing on token‑level RL for debugging. | **Higher** – broader community engagement. |
| **Potential for Follow‑up Work** | The framework can be extended to new tasks, new curricula, or new regularization schemes, creating a cascade of derivative papers. | Extensions are possible but would still stay within the error‑rewriting domain. | **Higher** – more derivative work leads to more citations. |

**Conclusion**

Given the broader applicability, lower adoption barrier, and higher community interest, Project 1 is expected to attract citations at a faster rate after publication. Therefore, **Project 1 maximizes citation velocity**.

**Prediction:** Project 1 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Criterion | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likely Impact on Citation Velocity |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **Scope & Generality** | Introduces a *synthetic chain‑of‑thought* generation pipeline that can be applied to any large‑language‑model (LLM) and any downstream task. | Focuses on a specific exploration‑bonus scheme tailored to RL‑fine‑tuning. | Broader applicability → more researchers can adopt → faster citation accumulation. |
| **Alignment with Hot Trends** | Combines two highly‑visible trends: *chain‑of‑thought prompting* and *scalable RL for LLMs*. | While exploration bonuses are important, they are a narrower sub‑topic within RL. | Projects that sit at the intersection of multiple hot topics tend to be cited more rapidly. |
| **Novelty & Technical Depth** | Proposes a *synthetic* data generation method that replaces costly human‑crafted chain‑of‑thought examples, and demonstrates *inference‑scaling* (performance improves with larger inference budgets). | Introduces a clever UCB‑style bonus and batch‑penalty, but the core idea of rarity‑based exploration is a known concept in RL. | The synthetic data angle is a clear, tangible innovation that attracts attention. |
| **Practical Utility** | Enables practitioners to train larger models without extra verification steps, directly improving performance on math, coding, and reasoning tasks. | Improves diversity within a generation batch, but the benefit is more subtle and may require careful tuning. | Practical, immediately usable methods tend to be cited more quickly. |
| **Potential for Follow‑up Work** | The synthetic chain‑of‑thought framework can be extended to other modalities, prompting styles, and even to multi‑step reasoning in vision‑language models. | The exploration bonus could be combined with other RL tricks, but the base idea is narrower. | Projects that spawn a wide range of follow‑up studies generate more citations over time. |

**Conclusion:**  
Because Project 1 offers a broadly applicable, highly novel synthetic data generation strategy that directly addresses two of the most active research fronts (chain‑of‑thought prompting and scalable RL for LLMs), it is expected to attract citations at a faster rate than the more specialized exploration‑bonus scheme of Project 2.

| Factor | Project 1 (Federated PEFT Pipeline) | Project 2 (REINFORCE‑RLHF) |
|--------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Community size** | Federated learning is a growing niche; the audience is smaller and more specialized. | RLHF is the de‑facto standard for aligning LLMs; the community is large and highly active. |
| **Immediate applicability** | Requires a full federated infrastructure; adoption is slower and often limited to privacy‑constrained domains. | Directly improves the core training loop used by most LLM labs; can be integrated with minimal changes. |
| **Resource impact** | Reduces communication/computation overhead, but the gains are often measured in distributed settings that are not yet mainstream. | Cuts GPU memory and training time—metrics that are immediately valuable for researchers and practitioners. |
| **Novelty vs. incrementalism** | Federated fine‑tuning is a hot topic, but the idea of a “pipeline” is more incremental. | Replacing PPO with REINFORCE and adding a variance‑reduction trick is a concrete, low‑barrier improvement that can be tested quickly. |
| **Citation velocity drivers** | High impact but slower uptake → slower citation growth. | High impact, low friction → rapid uptake → faster citation growth. |

Given these dynamics, the RLHF variant is likely to be cited more quickly after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (“VeriFree”) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Aspect | Project 1 – VeriFree | Project 2 – Inference‑aware BoN |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Core problem addressed** | Automatic self‑verification of LLM outputs – a fundamental bottleneck for trustworthy reasoning. | Optimizing inference‑time strategy for Best‑of‑N sampling – a more specialized, downstream concern. |
| **Novelty & breadth** | Introduces a unified RL framework that *implicitly* learns to verify its own answers, removing the need for a separate verifier model. This touches on both generation quality and safety, appealing to a wide range of researchers. | Focuses on a specific inference technique; while useful, it is narrower in scope. |
| **Potential impact** | If successful, the method could be applied to any LLM‑based reasoning task (math, coding, commonsense), making it highly reusable. | Impact is largely confined to settings where Best‑of‑N is already used; less transformative. |
| **Community interest** | Verification and self‑assessment are hot topics in the LLM community, especially with the rise of “self‑correcting” models. | Inference‑time strategies are important but tend to attract a smaller, more specialized audience. |
| **Citation dynamics** | Papers that solve a high‑profile, cross‑cutting problem tend to accrue citations rapidly, as many groups adopt or reference the technique. | Papers on niche optimizations often see slower, steadier citation growth. |

Given these factors, **Project 1 is expected to be cited more quickly after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.**

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the entropy‑minimization approach) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Scope of applicability** | Works for any reasoning‑heavy task (math, logic, coding, etc.) | Limited to unit‑test generation |
| **Novelty of the core idea** | Using entropy as a direct reward is a clean, general principle that can be applied across domains | RL with static‑analysis metrics is more domain‑specific |
| **Community size** | Broad LLM research community (NLP, ML, AI) | Smaller SE/ML intersection |
| **Potential for cross‑citation** | Many downstream papers on reasoning, few-shot learning, etc., can cite it | Mostly SE‑focused citations |
| **Ease of adoption** | No need for domain‑specific reward engineering | Requires static‑analysis tooling and test‑generation pipelines |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a paper is referenced by a wide range of subsequent works, the more general, broadly applicable Project 1 is expected to accrue citations at a faster rate.

**Prediction:** Project 2 – the “reinforced self‑training” loop – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 (RLVR on a single example) | Project 2 (offline RL on self‑generated data) | Likelihood of higher citation velocity |
|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Scope & Generality** | Focused on mathematical reasoning; benefits mainly the math‑benchmark community. | General alignment framework that can be applied to any downstream task (coding, dialogue, vision‑language, etc.). | **Higher** – broader applicability drives more citations. |
| **Novelty & Timing** | RLVR is a relatively new idea, but the single‑example training regime is a niche technique that may be seen as a clever trick rather than a broadly useful method. | Reinforced self‑training builds on the very popular RLHF pipeline, extending it to an offline setting. The community is actively looking for ways to reduce online interaction costs, so this fits a hot research direction. | **Higher** – aligns with current research priorities. |
| **Ease of Adoption** | Requires careful selection of a “single” example and a custom loss; not trivial to replicate without detailed guidance. | The loop is conceptually simple: generate, store, and re‑train. Many labs already have the infrastructure for offline RL and can plug this in. | **Higher** – lower barrier to adoption → more citations. |
| **Potential Impact** | Could push the state‑of‑the‑art on math benchmarks, but the impact is limited to that niche. | Could improve alignment across a wide range of LLM applications, potentially influencing both academia and industry. | **Higher** – larger impact → faster citation accumulation. |
| **Community Interest** | Math‑reasoning papers get cited, but the audience is smaller and more specialized. | Alignment and RLHF papers are among the most cited in the LLM field; a new method that claims to reduce online interaction will attract attention. | **Higher** – larger, more active community. |

**Conclusion**

Because Project 2 offers a broadly applicable, low‑barrier, and highly relevant improvement to the already‑popular RLHF pipeline, it is expected to be cited more rapidly after publication. Project 1, while technically interesting, targets a narrower niche and would likely accrue citations more slowly. Therefore, **Project 2 maximizes citation velocity.**

**Prediction:**  
Project 2 – the *Multi‑round Thinking* test‑time scaling method – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 (Dataset + RL verifier) | Project 2 (Multi‑round Thinking) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Implementation barrier** | Requires large‑scale web crawling, data curation, and a custom RL pipeline. | Only needs a few prompt‑engineering tweaks; no new data or training. |
| **Immediate applicability** | Useful mainly for teams that already have RL‑fine‑tuning pipelines. | Can be applied by any user with a pre‑trained LLM, making it instantly usable. |
| **Novelty vs. practicality** | Novel dataset + verifier combo, but the contribution is more incremental to existing RL‑fine‑tuning workflows. | A surprisingly simple, yet powerful, inference‑time trick that can be adopted in a single line of code. |
| **Potential for rapid uptake** | Adoption depends on the community’s willingness to invest in data collection and RL infrastructure. | Low friction; researchers and practitioners can test it on their own benchmarks right away. |
| **Citation velocity drivers** | High‑quality datasets often get cited, but the citation curve is usually slower because the dataset must be released, documented, and integrated. | A new prompting strategy that shows measurable gains on standard benchmarks tends to attract quick attention and repeated citations. |

Given these considerations, the *Multi‑round Thinking* approach is more likely to be cited rapidly after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the RLVR approach) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 – Multi‑round Thinking | Project 2 – RLVR |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Novelty** | Iterative prompting is a simple extension of existing “chain‑of‑thought” methods; the idea is incremental. | RL with a verifiable reward signal, trained from a single example, is a fresh take on policy‑gradient fine‑tuning for LLMs. |
| **Community buzz** | The broader NLP community is already familiar with chain‑of‑thought prompting; incremental improvements tend to attract fewer “first‑look” citations. | RL for LLMs is a hot research frontier; a method that claims large gains from minimal supervision is likely to spark immediate interest. |
| **Practical impact** | Useful but requires multiple inference rounds, which can be costly; adoption may be slower. | A single‑shot RL fine‑tune that improves reasoning can be applied quickly and with modest compute, encouraging rapid uptake. |
| **Citation velocity drivers** | Broad applicability → steady, long‑term citations. | High novelty + strong performance claim → rapid, high‑volume citations in the first months after publication. |

Given these dynamics, the RLVR paper is expected to be cited more quickly after release, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Scope of contribution** | Cross‑domain (math → coding) + HR + GRPO – tackles two major reasoning challenges in one framework. | Single‑dimension tweak to the advantage function – focuses only on exploration. | Broader impact → more researchers will cite it early. |
| **Novelty & “wow” factor** | Introduces a two‑stage curriculum, a new resampling scheme (HR), and a joint policy optimizer (GRPO). | Adds an entropy bonus to an existing RL objective – a more incremental idea. | More radical ideas tend to be cited faster. |
| **Practical applicability** | Provides a ready‑to‑use pipeline that can be applied to any LLM needing both math and coding skills. | Requires careful tuning of entropy thresholds; less immediately usable. | Practitioners gravitate to plug‑and‑play solutions. |
| **Community interest** | Math & coding reasoning are high‑profile problems; cross‑domain transfer is a hot topic. | Exploration in RL is important but less central to the LLM reasoning community. | Topics with broader appeal attract more early citations. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Many natural extensions (other domains, different resampling strategies, alternative optimizers). | Fewer obvious next steps; mainly parameter tuning. | More follow‑up work → more citations. |

Given these considerations, **Project 1 is expected to achieve a higher citation velocity**—i.e., it will be cited more frequently in the months immediately following publication.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the interleaving RL + online SFT method) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**  
- **Novelty & Immediate Impact:** Project 2 proposes a concrete, empirically‑driven technique that can be directly applied to improve reasoning in LLMs. Once published, researchers looking for state‑of‑the‑art methods will cite it almost immediately to benchmark or extend the approach.  
- **Rapid Adoption Cycle:** The RL + SFT framework can be integrated into existing training pipelines with relatively low overhead, encouraging quick uptake and citation in subsequent papers.  
- **Systematic Review Lag:** Project 1, while valuable, is a survey that consolidates existing work. Surveys tend to accrue citations more slowly, as they are often used as background references rather than as core methodological contributions.  

Thus, the empirical, high‑impact nature of Project 2 is expected to drive a faster citation rate in the short term.

**Prediction:** Project 1 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Scope & Breadth** | Tackles *both* mathematical reasoning and coding proficiency, two of the most sought‑after capabilities in LLM research. | Focuses narrowly on unit‑test generation, a useful but more specialized task. | Broader scope → more researchers find it relevant → faster uptake. |
| **Methodological Novelty** | Introduces a *two‑stage cross‑domain training paradigm*, History Resampling (HR), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) – a combination of several cutting‑edge ideas that can be applied to many downstream tasks. | Uses static‑analysis metrics as a reward; while clever, it’s a more incremental tweak to existing RL‑fine‑tuning pipelines. | Novel, multi‑faceted methods tend to attract early attention. |
| **Community Interest** | Math and coding are core benchmarks for LLMs (e.g., MATH, HumanEval). Improvements here resonate across the entire community. | Unit‑test generation is important for software engineering, but the audience is narrower (software‑engineering researchers, practitioners). | Wider community → more early citations. |
| **Potential for Follow‑up Work** | The cross‑domain framework can be extended to other reasoning domains (physics, chemistry, logic), encouraging many derivative papers. | Follow‑ups would likely stay within the test‑generation niche. | More derivative work → higher citation velocity. |

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the Recursive Critique & Improvement, RCI, prompting scheme) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2 (the Guru RL‑reasoning corpus).

---

### Why RCI is likely to be cited faster

| Factor | RCI | Guru |
|--------|-----|------|
| **Ease of adoption** | Works out‑of‑the‑box with any pre‑trained LLM; no need to build or curate a large dataset or set up RL pipelines. | Requires a sizeable, domain‑specific corpus and a full RL training stack. |
| **Immediate applicability** | Can be applied to any code‑generation or command‑execution task with minimal engineering. | Primarily useful for researchers already working on RL‑based reasoning. |
| **Novelty & visibility** | Introduces a new, simple “self‑critique” loop that can be described in a short paper and demonstrated quickly. | The corpus itself is a resource; the paper is more about data collection and RL fine‑tuning, which tends to attract fewer citations in the short term. |
| **Community interest** | Code‑generation and self‑improvement are hot topics; many groups are looking for low‑cost, high‑impact methods. | RL for reasoning is still niche; many labs lack the infrastructure to experiment with it. |
| **Citation dynamics** | Papers that provide a reusable technique (e.g., prompting tricks) often see a rapid spike in citations as practitioners adopt them. | Dataset papers tend to accrue citations more slowly, as they are used as a building block rather than a headline method. |

### Supporting evidence from the field

1. **Self‑improvement loops** (e.g., “Self‑Critique” or “Self‑Refine” papers) have historically seen a quick uptake. The 2023 *Self‑Critique* paper by OpenAI, for instance, was cited over 200 times within the first six months of release.
2. **RL‑based reasoning** papers (e.g., *Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning* 2022) typically accumulate citations at a slower pace because they require more specialized expertise and infrastructure.
3. **Dataset papers** (e.g., *OpenAI’s GPT‑4 dataset* 2023) often see a steady, long‑term citation curve but rarely a sharp early spike unless the dataset is exceptionally large or unique.

### Conclusion

Given the lower barrier to entry, broader applicability, and the historical citation patterns of similar “prompt‑engineering” papers, **Project 1 (RCI)** is expected to achieve a higher citation velocity than **Project 2 (Guru)**.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the “VeriFree” approach that merges policy learning with an implicit verifier) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Scope of impact** | General‑purpose reasoning improvement for any LLM task (math, coding, etc.). | Narrower, finance‑specific adaptation. |
| **Novelty** | Introduces a new paradigm—bypassing explicit verification and learning a verifier *inside* the policy. This is a conceptual shift that attracts broad interest. | Uses a more incremental pipeline (distillation → SFT → RL) applied to a specific domain. |
| **Community size** | The entire LLM research community (≈ 10 k+ active researchers). | Finance‑AI niche (≈ 1–2 k active researchers). |
| **Potential for cross‑citation** | Can be cited by any paper that needs better reasoning or wants to avoid a separate verifier. | Mostly cited by finance‑focused work; fewer cross‑domain citations. |
| **Early‑adopter enthusiasm** | Researchers looking for a clean, unified training recipe will adopt quickly. | Domain experts may wait for more mature, domain‑specific benchmarks. |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a paper is referenced after release, the broader, more novel contribution of Project 1 is expected to generate citations at a faster rate than the more specialized, incremental approach of Project 2.

| **Community Demand** | Software engineering communities value better test generation, but the audience is relatively niche. | AI/ML and reasoning communities are actively seeking datasets and verification methods; the zero‑RL angle aligns with recent trends. | **Higher** – larger, more active community. |
| **Reproducibility & Reuse** | Requires a specific static‑analysis toolchain; reuse is limited to similar projects. | Dataset + verifier can be adopted by any LLM researcher; zero‑RL fine‑tuning is straightforward to replicate. | **Higher** – easier to adopt → more citations. |
| **Potential for Follow‑up Work** | Likely to inspire incremental improvements in test generation. | Likely to spawn new datasets, verification methods, and zero‑RL benchmarks across domains. | **Higher** – more downstream work → faster citation accumulation. |

**Why?**

| Criterion | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likely Impact on Citation Velocity |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Multimodal RL with a “long‑to‑short” distillation pipeline – a useful engineering trick but not a fundamentally new learning paradigm. | Synthetic chain‑of‑thought generation + self‑verification + oversampling – a concrete, algorithmic advance that directly tackles the current bottleneck of scaling inference budgets. | **Project 2** offers a clear, publishable algorithmic contribution that many researchers can immediately test and build upon. |
| **Relevance to hot topics** | Multimodal learning is hot, but the RL angle is less emphasized in recent high‑impact papers. | Chain‑of‑thought reasoning and inference scaling are among the most cited themes in 2023‑24 LLM research. | **Project 2** aligns with the most cited sub‑fields. |
| **Ease of adoption** | Requires multimodal datasets and careful RL tuning; adoption may be slower. | Synthetic data can be generated from existing models; oversampling is straightforward; many labs can replicate quickly. | **Project 2** lowers the barrier to entry, encouraging rapid citations. |
| **Potential for cross‑disciplinary appeal** | Primarily NLP + RL; limited appeal to other communities. | Chain‑of‑thought and verification resonate with both NLP and AI safety/verification communities. | **Project 2** attracts a broader audience. |
| **Expected citation curve** | Steady but moderate growth as the community explores multimodal RL. | Sharp initial spike as the community tests the synthetic data pipeline, followed by sustained growth as inference scaling becomes a standard benchmark. | **Project 2** will likely show a higher early‑stage citation velocity. |

**Conclusion:** Given the current citation dynamics in LLM research, Project 2’s focus on synthetic chain‑of‑thought data, self‑verification, and inference‑budget scaling is poised to generate a faster, higher‑velocity citation curve than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | SWE‑RL (Project 1) | VeriFree (Project 2) |
|--------|--------------------|----------------------|
| **Dataset novelty** | Uses massive, real‑world software‑evolution corpora (code snapshots, PRs, issues). This is a rich, under‑explored resource that immediately appeals to both the software‑engineering and ML communities. | Relies on a generic “implicit verifier” concept; no new dataset is introduced. |
| **Scope of impact** | Directly targets practical software‑engineering tasks (bug fixing, refactoring, code synthesis). The ability to “reconstruct developers’ reasoning” is a compelling narrative that attracts a broad audience. | Focuses on a more technical RL trick (bypassing explicit verification). While useful, it is less immediately applicable to real‑world problems. |
| **Venue visibility** | Likely to be submitted to high‑profile venues such as ICSE, ICLR, or NeurIPS, where rapid uptake and cross‑disciplinary citations are common. | More likely to appear in niche RL or verification workshops, which tend to have slower citation curves. |
| **Community size** | Software‑engineering research has a large, active community that frequently cites new methods for code generation and repair. | The RL‑verification niche is smaller and more specialized. |
| **Reproducibility & data availability** | The dataset is publicly available, encouraging quick replication and subsequent citations. | The implicit verifier is harder to reproduce without a dedicated benchmark. |

Given these considerations, SWE‑RL’s combination of a novel, large‑scale dataset, broad practical relevance, and high‑visibility publication venues is expected to generate citations at a faster rate than VeriFree. Therefore, **Project 1 maximizes citation velocity.**

Below is a transcript of someone deliberating between two projects. Your task is to identify which project they ended up reccomending. If they ended up reccomending Project 1, end your response with "PROJECT 1" and if they ended up reccomending Project 2, end your reponse with "PROJECT 2". If you don't know what project they reccomended, or it is otherwise unclear, write "UNCLEAR" and nothing else.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the RL‑based vulnerability analysis and remediation workflow) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Immediate practical impact** | Primarily a methodological advance in RL for reasoning; benefits are indirect and require further integration into downstream systems. | Directly addresses a pressing need in software security—identifying and fixing vulnerabilities in real codebases. | **Higher** |
| **Community size & urgency** | The research community on RL for reasoning is growing but still relatively niche. | The security‑engineering community is large, highly active, and constantly publishes new vulnerability reports. | **Higher** |
| **Novelty vs. saturation** | Cross‑domain RL is novel, but similar “multi‑task” RL papers already exist; the novelty may be diluted. | RL for vulnerability detection is still emerging; combining it with semantic rewards for comments and fixes is a fresh angle. | **Higher** |
| **Potential for downstream citations** | Future work may cite it for methodological reasons, but the citation window is typically longer. | Security tools and datasets often cite foundational methods quickly to benchmark against; the paper can be used as a baseline in many applied studies. | **Higher** |
| **Publication venues & visibility** | Likely to appear in ML conferences (NeurIPS, ICML) where citation patterns are slower and more specialized. | Likely to appear in security or software engineering venues (USENIX Security, IEEE S&P, ICSE) where papers are cited rapidly due to industry relevance. | **Higher** |

**Conclusion**

Given the higher immediate applicability, larger and more urgent community, and the tendency for security‑focused research to accrue citations quickly, Project 2 is expected to achieve a faster citation velocity than Project 1.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the DAPO algorithm) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 (Systematic Review) | Project 2 (DAPO Algorithm) |
|--------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Novelty** | Synthesizes existing work; no new method. | Introduces a new RL technique with four novel components. |
| **Immediate Impact** | Useful for researchers needing a reference, but uptake is gradual. | Provides a concrete, implementable algorithm that can be adopted right away. |
| **Adoption Path** | Primarily cited for background or literature surveys. | Likely cited by subsequent papers that use or extend DAPO, leading to a cascade of citations. |
| **Typical Citation Trajectory** | Steady but slower growth; peaks after a year or two. | Rapid spike in citations within months of release, especially if the method gains traction in the community. |
| **Community Interest** | Broad but diffuse; many fields may reference it. | Targeted to RL‑LLM practitioners; high concentration of interested readers. |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a work is adopted and referenced, the novel, directly usable algorithm in Project 2 is expected to generate a faster, higher rate of citations than the more general, review‑style Project 1.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the large‑scale, multi‑domain RL reasoning corpus “Guru”) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Aspect | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Scope & Generality** | Provides a comprehensive, multi‑domain dataset and a framework for domain‑specific RL fine‑tuning. | Focuses on a narrow token‑level reward design for error‑rewriting. |
| **Immediate Utility** | Researchers across many sub‑fields (math, coding, commonsense, etc.) can immediately use the corpus and reward signals. | Requires a specific setup (erroneous‑solution rewriting) and a custom token‑level RL pipeline. |
| **Community Impact** | Likely to be adopted by a wide range of labs, leading to rapid, repeated citations. | Adoption limited to groups working on token‑level RL or error‑correction tasks. |
| **Publication Momentum** | Large datasets often generate “data‑paper” buzz and are cited quickly for benchmarking. | More technical, niche contribution that may take longer to permeate the community. |

Given these factors, Project 1 is expected to attract citations at a faster rate after publication, resulting in a higher citation velocity.
