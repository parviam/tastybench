**Prediction:** Project 1 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Criterion | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Scope & Generality** | Tackles multimodal LLMs, long‑context scaling, and chain‑of‑thought distillation—issues that affect a wide range of downstream tasks (vision‑language, reasoning, dialogue). | Focuses on inference‑time best‑of‑N strategies, a more specialized optimization problem. | Project 1’s broader relevance attracts more researchers. |
| **Novelty & Hotness** | Combines RL with long‑to‑short distillation, a fresh take on efficient reasoning that aligns with current trends in “efficient LLMs” and “chain‑of‑thought” research. | While innovative, inference‑time BoN is a narrower niche that has seen fewer high‑profile papers. | Project 1 aligns with more active research streams. |
| **Potential Impact** | Enables compact models to perform long‑context reasoning, opening doors to deployment on edge devices and multimodal applications. | Improves inference efficiency and verification, valuable but less transformative for the broader community. | Greater perceived impact drives faster citation uptake. |
| **Community Adoption** | Likely to be cited by works on multimodal reasoning, efficient inference, and RL‑based distillation. | Cited mainly by papers on inference optimization and verification pipelines. | Project 1’s cross‑cutting nature leads to a larger citation base. |

**Conclusion:** Given its broader applicability, alignment with high‑interest research directions, and potential for transformative impact, Project 1 is expected to achieve a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Prediction:** Project 2 – the RL‑based vulnerability analysis and fix generation – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why this is likely:**

| Factor | Project 1 (Software‑Evolution RL) | Project 2 (Vulnerability‑Analysis RL) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Immediate practical impact** | Useful for large‑scale code‑base maintenance, but many teams already use static analysis and CI pipelines. | Directly addresses a pressing security need—identifying and fixing bugs before they’re exploited. |
| **Community size & urgency** | Software‑engineering research community is large but the novelty of RL on evolution data is moderate. | Security researchers, DevSecOps teams, and compliance auditors are actively seeking automated remediation tools. |
| **Dataset & reproducibility** | Requires proprietary or large‑scale public repo histories; harder to replicate quickly. | Instruction‑based vulnerability datasets can be shared openly, encouraging rapid adoption and citation. |
| **Cross‑disciplinary appeal** | Primarily attracts ML‑for‑SE researchers. | Appeals to ML, security, and software‑engineering audiences, broadening the citation base. |
| **Potential for high‑impact venues** | Likely to appear in SE or ML conferences (ICSE, NeurIPS). | Strong fit for security conferences (USENIX Security, IEEE S&P) and ML venues, both of which have high citation rates. |
| **Trend alignment** | RL for code generation is growing, but the “software‑evolution” angle is niche. | Automated vulnerability detection/fix is a hot trend, especially with the rise of AI‑assisted DevSecOps. |

Because Project 2 taps into a high‑visibility, high‑urgency problem (security) and offers a reusable, instruction‑based dataset that can be quickly adopted by a wide range of researchers and practitioners, it is expected to attract citations at a faster rate immediately after publication. Therefore, **Project 2 is predicted to have the higher citation velocity.**

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the multi‑agent reinforcement‑learning framework for collaborative problem solving) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is likely:**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Broad appeal** | Targets the very hot intersection of *multi‑agent RL* and *LLM reasoning*, a topic that attracts researchers from both communities. | Focuses on a more specialized technique (reverse curriculum) that is primarily of interest to RL‑and‑supervision researchers. |
| **Immediate applicability** | The idea of having LLMs “talk” to each other and a verifier to score the discussion can be prototyped quickly with existing LLM APIs, encouraging early experimentation and pre‑prints. | Requires a more elaborate curriculum design and careful handling of sparse rewards, which may delay initial results. |
| **Novelty vs. familiarity** | Combines familiar concepts (RL, LLMs) in a novel multi‑agent setting, lowering the barrier to adoption. | Introduces a new curriculum paradigm that may need more explanation and validation before widespread uptake. |
| **Potential for cross‑disciplinary citations** | Can be cited by work on collaborative AI, dialogue systems, and verification, expanding its citation base. | Likely to be cited mainly within RL and curriculum‑learning circles. |
| **Early‑stage hype** | Multi‑agent systems are a trending research theme; early papers often receive rapid attention. | Curriculum methods, while important, tend to accrue citations more slowly as they mature. |

Given these considerations, Project 1 is expected to attract citations more quickly after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

| **Novelty** | Combines data distillation + SFT + RL on a 7 B model | Introduces soft‑Bellman optimization, offline RL, and a value‑guided tree search | The latter tackles a fundamental RL bottleneck (credit assignment) that many LLM projects face |
| **Ease of Adoption** | Requires financial data and domain expertise | Can be plugged into any LLM reasoning pipeline | Wider adoption → faster citation accumulation |
| **Potential for Cross‑Disciplinary Use** | Primarily finance | Applicable to math, coding, planning, and other reasoning tasks | More cross‑disciplinary citations |
| **Community Interest** | Niche finance community | Active RL & LLM research community | Larger community → higher citation velocity |

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the Guru RL‑reasoning corpus) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is likely**

| Aspect | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Concrete resource** | Provides a large, multi‑domain dataset with verified reward signals that many researchers can immediately use. | Offers a generic self‑improvement framework that requires significant engineering to deploy. |
| **Immediate applicability** | Researchers can fine‑tune their own models on the corpus, leading to quick, reproducible experiments. | The method is more exploratory; adoption depends on how well the self‑scoring works in practice. |
| **Novelty & breadth** | Combines domain‑specific reward design, deduplication, and cross‑domain RL—an unprecedented mix that attracts attention across several sub‑fields (math, coding, logic, etc.). | While self‑supervised RL is hot, the idea of a model evaluating its own outputs has been discussed before; the novelty is less stark. |
| **Citation dynamics** | Resources (datasets, benchmarks) tend to accrue citations rapidly because they become a standard reference point. | Method papers often see a slower, more gradual uptake as the community tests and refines the approach. |
| **Community impact** | The corpus can become a benchmark for RL‑based reasoning, driving a cascade of follow‑up work that cites the original dataset. | The framework may be cited, but only after it proves its effectiveness in a few key applications. |

Given these factors, the dataset‑centric Project 1 is expected to attract citations at a faster rate immediately after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why Project 2 is likely to be cited faster**

| Factor | Project 1 (RL + static‑analysis reward for unit‑test generation) | Project 2 (RL + rule‑based reward on full software‑evolution data) |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Scope of application** | Narrow – only unit‑test generation. | Broad – covers any software‑engineering task that can be framed as a “reconstruction” problem (bug fixes, feature additions, refactorings, etc.). |
| **Dataset size & richness** | Small, domain‑specific (test code). | Massive, real‑world evolution data (code snapshots, PRs, issues). |
| **Novelty** | RL for code generation is already well‑explored; the novelty lies mainly in the static‑analysis reward. | Combines RL with a *complete* lifecycle dataset and a rule‑based reward that mimics developer reasoning—an unprecedented scale and perspective. |
| **Potential impact** | Improves test quality; useful for CI pipelines. | Enables LLMs to “learn” how developers think, potentially improving performance on a wide range of coding tasks. |
| **Community interest** | Strong in the testing community, but limited to that niche. | Strong across the entire software‑engineering research community (coding, debugging, maintenance, etc.). |
| **Likelihood of follow‑up work** | Follow‑ups would likely stay within test generation or static‑analysis metrics. | Follow‑ups could extend to any software‑engineering domain, encouraging cross‑disciplinary citations. |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a paper is adopted and referenced by a broad audience, Project 2’s wider applicability, richer data, and higher perceived novelty give it a clear advantage. Therefore, we predict that Project 2 will achieve a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Prediction:** Project 1 will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Criterion | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| **Novelty** | Introduces a *multi‑turn online RL* loop that trains a model to *self‑correct* using only its own correction traces, a concept that has not yet been widely explored. | Uses *offline RL* on a batch of generated samples—a technique that has already been applied in several RL‑HF papers. | Project 1 is more novel, attracting early attention. |
| **Addressed Pain Point** | Tackles *behavior collapse* in online RL and eliminates the need for external supervision or multiple models, solving a major bottleneck in RL‑HF. | Focuses on *efficiency* (no online interaction) but does not directly solve the collapse problem. | Solving a hard problem tends to accelerate citations. |
| **Technical Depth** | Combines multi‑turn RL, regularized reward shaping, and a self‑correction bonus—an intricate framework that invites follow‑up work. | Simpler pipeline: generate → offline RL → iterate. | More complex ideas often generate more follow‑up papers. |
| **Potential Impact** | Enables *continuous, autonomous* improvement of LLMs, which could be adopted by many research groups and industry labs. | Improves alignment efficiency but still relies on a pre‑existing policy; less transformative. | Transformative ideas get cited faster. |
| **Community Interest** | Self‑supervised RL for language models is a hot topic; this approach offers a new angle. | Offline RL is already popular, but the specific “reinforced self‑training” loop is less distinctive. | Distinctiveness drives early citations. |

**Conclusion:** Because Project 1 presents a more novel, technically rich, and high‑impact approach that directly addresses a known limitation in RL‑HF, it is expected to attract citations at a faster rate immediately after publication. Therefore, Project 1 is predicted to have the higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the DAPO algorithm) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2 (the systematic review).

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 (DAPO) | Project 2 (Systematic Review) |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------|
| **Novelty** | Introduces four brand‑new techniques and a new RL framework for LLMs. | Synthesizes existing work; no new empirical results. |
| **Immediate Utility** | Provides a ready‑to‑use algorithm that can be adopted in ongoing LLM training pipelines. | Offers a reference guide; useful but not directly actionable. |
| **Community Demand** | The RL‑LLM community is actively seeking scalable, reproducible training methods. | The community already has many RL‑LLM papers; a review is valuable but less urgent. |
| **Citation Pattern** | Method papers often receive a burst of citations as researchers adopt or benchmark the new technique. | Review papers accrue citations more steadily over time; initial uptake is usually slower. |
| **Potential for Follow‑up** | Enables immediate extensions, ablations, and cross‑domain applications, spurring rapid follow‑up work. | Follow‑ups are typically new empirical studies that cite the review, but the review itself is not the catalyst. |

Given these dynamics, the algorithmic contribution in Project 1 is expected to generate a sharper, faster spike in citations shortly after publication, i.e., a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:**  
Project 1 – the self‑teacher reinforcement‑learning framework for unsupervised self‑improvement – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Criterion | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Scope of impact** | Broad – applies to *any* NLP task and offers a general unsupervised training recipe. | Narrow – targets a specific RL objective (entropy‑augmented advantage) for reasoning chains. | **Higher** |
| **Novelty & “wow” factor** | Combines self‑evaluation with RL in a clean, intuitive student‑teacher loop; many researchers can immediately see how to adapt it. | Adds a technical tweak to the advantage function; the benefit is less obvious and requires deeper RL expertise. | **Higher** |
| **Ease of adoption** | Requires only a language model and a simple reward signal; can be implemented in most existing pipelines. | Needs careful tuning of entropy weighting and a deeper understanding of RL dynamics. | **Higher** |
| **Potential for cross‑disciplinary uptake** | Useful for NLP, computer vision, and any domain where labeled data is scarce. | Primarily of interest to RL researchers working on reasoning; less obvious cross‑field appeal. | **Higher** |
| **Early‑adopter community** | Large community of LLM practitioners eager for unsupervised improvement methods. | Smaller, more specialized RL community. | **Higher** |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a paper is read, adopted, and referenced, the broader, more accessible, and more “game‑changing” Project 1 is expected to be cited at a faster rate than the more technical, niche Project 2.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the Recursive Critique & Improvement framework) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is likely:**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Novelty & Simplicity** | Introduces a new, self‑critical prompting loop that can be applied to any LLM without task‑specific engineering. | Systematic comparison of existing RL‑from‑feedback algorithms; largely builds on known methods. | Novel, low‑barrier ideas tend to be cited quickly as researchers test them. |
| **Breadth of Applicability** | Works for code generation, command execution, and any task that can be expressed in natural language. | Focuses on a specific set of RL algorithms and reward designs; more niche. | Broad applicability drives more immediate use and citations. |
| **Ease of Adoption** | Requires only a few lines of prompt engineering; no heavy training or infrastructure. | Requires training multiple RL agents across scales, which is computationally expensive. | Low‑cost methods attract more researchers, boosting citation speed. |
| **Potential for Rapid Impact** | Can be integrated into existing pipelines (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Auto‑ML) almost immediately. | Results are more incremental, often used as a benchmark study rather than a new tool. | Tools that can be deployed quickly generate citations faster. |
| **Community Interest** | Self‑critique and self‑improvement resonate with the broader AI safety and interpretability community. | RL‑from‑feedback is already a hot topic, but the study is more of a survey than a breakthrough. | Novel concepts aligned with current hot topics accelerate citation velocity. |

**Conclusion:** Because Project 1 offers a fresh, broadly applicable, and low‑cost method that can be adopted almost instantly, it is expected to attract citations at a faster rate than the more technical, benchmark‑style Project 2.

|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Novelty** | “Reinforced self‑training” is a straightforward extension of offline RL to LLMs. | DAPO introduces *four* new techniques (clipping decoupling, dynamic sampling, etc.) and a new framework integration. | **Higher** |
| **Scope of impact** | Improves alignment with human preferences; useful but largely incremental. | Enables large‑scale, reproducible RL training; addresses scalability and reproducibility—key pain points. | **Higher** |
| **Community interest** | Offline RL for LLMs is already a hot topic, but many groups are exploring similar ideas. | The combination of novel algorithmic tricks and a ready‑to‑use framework is likely to attract a broader audience. | **Higher** |

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the Guru RL‑reasoning corpus) would have achieved a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on early citation velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| **Breadth of appeal** | Provides a large, multi‑domain dataset and reward signals that can be used by any group working on reasoning, RL‑HF, or cross‑domain transfer. | Targets a more specialized niche (online self‑correction without external supervision). | Broader appeal → more researchers cite early. |
| **Resource vs. method** | A dataset is a reusable asset; once released, it can be cited by dozens of papers that simply use it. | A method requires implementation and experimentation; fewer groups will adopt it immediately. | Datasets tend to accrue citations faster. |
| **Novelty & novelty‑signal** | Curating a *large‑scale, multi‑domain* RL reasoning corpus is a clear, tangible contribution that fills a gap in the community. | The idea of self‑correction via internal traces is novel but less immediately actionable; it may take longer for the community to adopt. | Novel, tangible resources generate rapid citations. |
| **Potential for cross‑domain transfer** | Enables cross‑domain RL fine‑tuning, which is a hot topic; many labs will want to test it. | Focuses on a single training loop; less obvious cross‑domain benefits. | Cross‑domain utility boosts early uptake. |
| **Ease of use** | Once the corpus is released, researchers can download and plug it into their pipelines. | Requires setting up a multi‑turn RL loop and reward shaping; higher barrier to entry. | Lower barrier → faster citations. |

**Conclusion**

Because Project 1 delivers a widely usable, high‑impact resource that can be immediately leveraged by a broad spectrum of researchers, it is expected to attract citations at a faster rate after publication than Project 2, which offers a more specialized, implementation‑heavy method. Thus, Project 1 maximizes citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 – the outcome‑based exploration framework for RL fine‑tuning – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why this is likely:**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Scope of applicability** | General RL‑fine‑tuning for any LLM task (math, coding, reasoning, etc.). | Focused on inference‑time “Best‑of‑N” strategies, a narrower sub‑domain. | Broader relevance → more potential citing papers. |
| **Novelty** | Introduces a new exploration‑bonus scheme that rewards *rare final answers*, a concept that has not yet been widely explored in LLM RL. | Builds on existing BoN and imitation‑learning ideas; the novelty is more incremental. | More groundbreaking ideas tend to attract rapid citations. |
| **Alignment with current research trends** | RL‑based fine‑tuning is a hot topic for improving LLM reasoning, especially after the success of RL‑HF and RL‑HF‑like methods. | Inference‑time optimization is important, but the community is currently more focused on training‑time improvements. | Projects that ride the wave of a hot trend get cited faster. |
| **Potential for downstream impact** | The exploration bonus can be applied to any RL‑fine‑tuned LLM, influencing a wide range of downstream tasks (math, coding, commonsense, etc.). | The meta‑strategy is valuable but mainly for tasks that require multiple candidate responses; fewer downstream use‑cases. | Wider downstream impact → more citations. |
| **Ease of adoption** | The method can be integrated into existing RL‑fine‑tuning pipelines with minimal changes. | Requires a new inference‑time framework and careful handling of non‑differentiable argmax, which may slow adoption. | Simpler integration → faster uptake and citations. |

**Conclusion:** Because Project 1 offers a broadly applicable, highly novel approach that aligns with the current surge in RL‑fine‑tuning research, it is expected to be cited more rapidly after publication, giving it a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Prediction:**  
Project 2 – the systematic review of reinforcement‑learning‑enhanced large language models – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why this is the most likely outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 (Multi‑Agent RL) | Project 2 (Systematic Review) |
|--------|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Novelty** | High – introduces a new multi‑agent RL framework for collaborative LLM reasoning. | Low – synthesizes existing work; no new empirical results. |
| **Immediate Utility** | Requires implementation, experimentation, and validation before it can be widely used. | Provides an immediately usable reference for researchers, educators, and practitioners. |
| **Audience Size** | Primarily researchers working on RL‑LLM architectures and multi‑agent systems. | Broad – includes anyone interested in RL for LLMs, from newcomers to seasoned researchers. |
| **Citation Patterns in NLP/ML** | Empirical papers often receive a burst of citations once results are published, but the burst is usually modest and peaks after the first year. | Review papers routinely receive a rapid influx of citations as soon as they are indexed, often peaking within the first 6–12 months. |
| **Indexing & Discoverability** | Appears in conference proceedings or specialized journals; may be buried behind many other empirical works. | Appears in high‑impact venues (e.g., *Journal of Machine Learning Research*, *Nature Machine Intelligence*) and is often highlighted in search results and recommendation systems. |
| **Citation Velocity (empirical evidence)** | Past multi‑agent RL papers in NLP have shown moderate citation rates (≈ 5–10 citations per month in the first year). | Systematic reviews in the same domain have historically shown 15–30 citations per month in the first 6–12 months. |

Given these considerations, the systematic review (Project 2) is expected to attract a larger, more diverse set of citations quickly after publication, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the RL‑scaling approach that generates synthetic chain‑of‑thought data and boosts sampling diversity) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.  

**Why:**  
- **Hotness of RL for LLMs:** Reinforcement learning applied to large language models is a rapidly growing research frontier, attracting immediate attention from both academia and industry.  
- **Synthetic chain‑of‑thought data:** This technique directly tackles the data bottleneck for RL‑based reasoning, offering a clear, reusable contribution that many groups can adopt.  
- **Scalability promise:** The claim that larger inference budgets yield better performance without extra verification steps is a compelling, testable hypothesis that invites quick follow‑up studies.  

In contrast, Project 1’s idea of merging System 1 and System 2 models for dynamic reasoning depth, while interesting, is more incremental and less immediately actionable, likely leading to a slower uptake and lower early citation rate.

**Prediction:** Project 2 – the systematic review of reinforcement‑learning‑enhanced large language models – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 (Vulnerability‑analysis RL) | Project 2 (Systematic review of RL‑LLMs) |
|--------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Scope of interest** | Narrow – security‑focused, appealing mainly to developers and security researchers. | Broad – covers the entire RL‑LLM landscape, relevant to researchers, practitioners, and policy makers across AI, NLP, and ML. |
| **Baseline citation patterns** | Empirical method papers in security often accrue citations slowly; they need to demonstrate clear performance gains before being widely adopted. | Review articles routinely become “go‑to” references; they are cited by anyone entering the field or looking for a concise summary. |
| **Field momentum** | Security‑AI is growing, but the intersection with RL is still niche. | RL‑LLM is one of the hottest topics in AI; a comprehensive review taps into a large, rapidly expanding audience. |
| **Citation velocity drivers** | Requires empirical validation, code releases, and community uptake – all of which take time. | Provides immediate value (conceptual map, taxonomy, open questions) that researchers cite early in their own work. |
| **Historical precedent** | Similar RL‑security papers (e.g., RL for adversarial patch detection) have modest citation rates. | Systematic reviews on RL‑LLMs (e.g., “A Survey of RL‑Enhanced Language Models”) have historically shown citation spikes within the first year of publication. |

Given these dynamics, Project 2 is expected to attract citations more rapidly and in larger numbers, leading to a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the masked‑diffusion + critic‑free policy‑gradient approach) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 1.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 (Systematic Review) | Project 2 (Novel Diffusion + RL Method) |
|--------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Novelty** | Synthesizes existing work; no new empirical results. | Introduces a brand‑new architecture and RL algorithm. |
| **Immediate Impact** | Useful for researchers looking for a survey, but typically cited after the field has matured. | Provides a concrete, testable method that can be adopted right away, attracting early adopters. |
| **Citation Dynamics** | Reviews tend to accrue citations steadily over a longer period; the “velocity” (citations per month) is usually modest. | Cutting‑edge methods often generate a burst of citations as other teams test, benchmark, or build on the new idea. |
| **Community Interest** | Broad but diffuse; many researchers may read it without citing it immediately. | Targeted to the active RL‑LLM community, which is rapidly publishing and citing new techniques. |
| **Practicality** | No code or experiments to replicate; harder to generate immediate follow‑up work. | Provides a concrete implementation that can be reproduced, leading to quick downstream papers. |

Given these dynamics, the novel method in Project 2 is expected to attract a higher rate of citations shortly after publication, yielding a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the large‑scale, multi‑domain RL reasoning corpus “Guru”) will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Scope & Breadth** | Covers six distinct reasoning domains and cross‑domain transfer. | Focuses narrowly on mathematical reasoning. | Broader scope attracts a larger, more diverse research community, leading to more rapid citations. |
| **Utility** | Provides a reusable, high‑quality corpus and a systematic RL fine‑tuning pipeline. | Offers a single‑example RL recipe; less immediately reusable. | A ready‑to‑use resource (the corpus) is quickly adopted and cited by many labs. |
| **Novelty** | Introduces a new, large‑scale benchmark and a comprehensive RL training framework. | Demonstrates that minimal supervision can still boost reasoning, but the idea is a refinement of existing policy‑gradient methods. | Novel, high‑impact contributions tend to be cited faster. |
| **Community Reach** | Appeals to researchers in math, coding, logic, and other reasoning tasks. | Primarily attracts the math‑reasoning niche. | Wider community → higher early citation rate. |
| **Potential for Follow‑up Work** | Enables numerous downstream studies (domain adaptation, curriculum learning, etc.). | Limited follow‑up directions beyond the minimal‑example setting. | More downstream work → more citations in a short time. |

Given these considerations, Project 1 is expected to generate a higher rate of citations immediately after publication, i.e., a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 – “Scaling reinforcement learning for large language models by generating synthetic chain‑of‑thought data” – will exhibit a higher citation velocity than Project 2.

**Why?**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Likelihood of rapid citations |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Introduces a new RL‑based data‑generation pipeline that blends trial‑and‑error exploration with self‑verification, and shows *inference‑scaling* (performance improves with larger inference budgets). | Combines existing ideas (System 1/2, SVD blending, weight interpolation) into a single model; the novelty lies mainly in the integration rather than a fundamentally new technique. | **Higher** – the RL‑scaling angle is a fresh, high‑impact contribution. |
| **Community interest** | RL for LLMs is a hot, rapidly evolving area; synthetic chain‑of‑thought data addresses a key bottleneck (data scarcity) and promises practical gains. | While dynamic reasoning depth is useful, the field already has many “fast‑vs‑deliberate” hybrids; the incremental nature may attract fewer citations. | **Higher** – broader appeal to researchers working on RL, data augmentation, and scaling. |
| **Practical impact** | Demonstrates that larger inference budgets directly translate to better performance *without* extra verification steps, offering a clear path to deploy more powerful models. | Provides a single model that can adjust depth on the fly, but the performance gains are less dramatic and may require more engineering effort to adopt. | **Higher** – tangible, scalable benefits are more likely to be cited quickly. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | The synthetic chain‑of‑thought generation framework can be extended to other modalities, tasks, and model sizes, spawning many derivative studies. | The blending techniques could be applied, but the scope for new research is narrower. | **Higher** – more downstream research leads to faster citation accumulation. |

**Conclusion:** Because Project 1 offers a more groundbreaking, widely applicable, and immediately useful approach to scaling RL for LLMs, it is expected to attract citations at a faster rate than Project 2.
