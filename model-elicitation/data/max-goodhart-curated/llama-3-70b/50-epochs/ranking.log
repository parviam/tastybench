**Project 2: Reverse-Curriculum Reinforcement Learning Framework**

This project proposes a reverse-curriculum reinforcement learning framework that transforms outcome-only supervision into step-wise guidance for large language models. By creating a curriculum that starts from the end of a demonstration and moves backward, the model can learn from easier sub-tasks first, decomposing sparse rewards into more informative intermediate signals. The advantages of this approach include:

- **Efficient Learning**: Starting with easier tasks can help the model learn more efficiently and effectively, potentially leading to better performance on complex tasks.
- **Precision in Error Localization**: The method allows for precise error localization without manual annotations, which could significantly reduce the need for human intervention and improve the model's ability to learn from its mistakes.

Given these considerations, **Project 2: Reverse-Curriculum Reinforcement Learning Framework** is likely to have a higher citation velocity. Here's why:

1. **Broader Applicability**: The reverse-curriculum approach can be applied to a wide range of tasks and domains, making it more universally relevant and potentially attractive to a broader audience of researchers.
2. **Innovation and Novelty**: Transforming outcome-only supervision into step-wise guidance through a reverse curriculum is a novel and innovative approach that addresses significant challenges in reinforcement learning, such as sparse rewards and the need for detailed annotations.
3. **Alignment with Current Trends**: The focus on efficient learning, autonomy, and the ability to learn from sparse rewards aligns well with current trends in AI research, which emphasizes the development of more efficient, autonomous, and generalizable learning systems.
4. **Potential Impact**: By enabling large language models to learn more effectively from sparse rewards and to localize errors precisely without manual annotations, this project has the potential to significantly impact the field, leading to more citations as researchers build upon, apply, and extend this work.

Below is a transcript of someone deliberating between two projects. Your task is to identify which project they ended up reccomending. If they ended up reccomending Project 1, end your response with "PROJECT 1" and if they ended up reccomending Project 2, end your reponse with "PROJECT 2". If you don't know what project they reccomended, or it is otherwise unclear, write "UNCLEAR" and nothing else.

To determine which project idea maximizes "citation velocity," we need to consider the novelty, impact, and relevance of each project to the current research landscape in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning.

**Project 1** focuses on scaling reinforcement learning for LLMs by generating synthetic chain-of-thought data and increasing sampling diversity. This approach aims to improve the model's performance by enabling inference scaling, where larger inference budgets directly improve performance without additional verification steps. While this project addresses a significant challenge in LLMs, its scope is somewhat narrow, focusing on a specific aspect of reinforcement learning.

**Project 2**, on the other hand, proposes a more comprehensive and innovative framework for unsupervised self-improvement of LLMs. The dual student-teacher framework, where the model generates answers and evaluates them using self-assigned quality scores, has the potential to revolutionize the way LLMs are trained and improved. This approach enables the model to learn from its own mistakes and adapt to new tasks without external supervision, which is a highly desirable trait in AI research.

Considering the broader impact and novelty of the ideas, I predict that **Project 2** will have a higher citation velocity. The dual student-teacher framework is more likely to attract attention from researchers in the field, as it:

1. Addresses a fundamental challenge in LLM training: the need for large amounts of labeled data.
2. Offers a novel and innovative solution that can be applied to various NLP tasks.
3. Has the potential to enable more efficient and effective training of LLMs, which is a critical area of research.

In contrast, while **Project 1** is still a valuable contribution to the field, its focus on scaling reinforcement learning for LLMs may be seen as a more incremental improvement, rather than a groundbreaking innovation.

Therefore, based on the project descriptions, I predict that **Project 2** will have a higher citation velocity due to its broader impact, novelty, and potential to revolutionize the field of LLM research.
