Below is a transcript of someone deliberating between two projects. Your task is to identify which project they ended up reccomending. If they ended up reccomending Project 1, end your response with "PROJECT 1" and if they ended up reccomending Project 2, end your reponse with "PROJECT 2". If you don't know what project they reccomended, or it is otherwise unclear, write "UNCLEAR" and nothing else.

To determine which project idea maximizes "citation velocity," we need to analyze the novelty, impact, and relevance of each project to the current research landscape in LLMs (Large Language Models) and reinforcement learning.

**Project 1** focuses on minimizing the entropy of language-model predictions to enhance the model's reasoning capabilities, particularly in tasks that require concentration of probability mass on the most confident tokens. This approach is innovative in its use of entropy reduction techniques, including fine-tuning with token-level entropy loss, reinforcement learning with negative entropy rewards, and logit adjustments at inference time. By directly targeting low-entropy outputs, this method has the potential to unlock latent reasoning abilities in pretrained LLMs without the need for labeled data, which is a significant advantage.

**Project 2** proposes a hierarchical reinforcement-learning framework designed to handle multi-turn interactions, long horizons, and delayed rewards in LLMs. This framework combines a high-level off-policy value-based RL algorithm with a low-level RL algorithm to train token-level policies within each turn. The approach aims to extend single-turn RL methods to more complex, multi-turn scenarios, which is crucial for real-world applications where interactions are often prolonged and involve multiple exchanges.

Given the current research interests and challenges in the field of LLMs and reinforcement learning, **Project 2** is likely to have a higher citation velocity. Here's why:

1. **Multi-turn Interactions**: Project 2 addresses the limitation of current single-turn RL methods by proposing a framework for multi-turn interactions. This is a significant advancement because many real-world applications, such as dialogue systems, customer service chatbots, and negotiation platforms, involve interactions that span multiple turns.

2. **Long Horizons and Delayed Rewards**: The ability to handle long horizons and delayed rewards is crucial for tasks that require sustained engagement and strategic planning. Project 2's approach to this challenge is likely to attract attention from researchers working on applications where immediate feedback is not always available.

3. **Flexibility and Efficiency**: By enabling efficient fine-tuning of large language models for agent tasks while preserving flexibility, Project 2 offers a practical solution for a wide range of applications. This balance between performance and adaptability is highly valued in the research community.

4. **Current Research Trends**: The field is currently seeing a surge in interest in multi-modal and multi-turn interaction models, as well as in methods that can efficiently handle complex, real-world scenarios. Project 2 aligns well with these trends, making it more likely to be cited frequently as researchers explore these areas further.

In contrast, while **Project 1** presents an innovative approach to enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities through entropy minimization, its focus is somewhat narrower, targeting the internal workings of the model to improve confidence in predictions. Although important, this might not resonate as broadly with the current research community's focus on applicability and scalability in complex, real-world scenarios.

**Prediction**: Based on the analysis, **Project 2** is predicted to have a higher citation velocity due to its comprehensive approach to handling multi-turn interactions, long horizons, and delayed rewards, which are critical challenges in the current landscape of LLM and reinforcement learning research.
