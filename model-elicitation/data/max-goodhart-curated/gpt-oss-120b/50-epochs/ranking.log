**Prediction:** The second project – the large‑scale, multi‑domain RL‑reasoning corpus (Guru) – is the one that would achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Why this is likely**

| Aspect | Project 1 (Entropy‑Minimization) | Project 2 (Guru Corpus) |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Core contribution** | A methodological tweak (entropy‑based loss / RL reward) that can be applied to any existing model. | A new, publicly released dataset + a systematic RL‑fine‑tuning pipeline across six reasoning domains. |
| **Typical citation drivers** | Method papers often get cited when the specific technique is adopted, which can be slower because researchers need to re‑implement the entropy loss or inference‑time logit adjustment. | Dataset papers tend to be cited immediately by anyone who uses the data, and the “benchmark‑plus‑RL‑pipeline” nature makes it a go‑to resource for many downstream works. |
| **Community interest** | Niche interest (entropy control) and may be perceived as a “trick” rather than a fundamental advance. | Broad interest across math, coding, logic, commonsense, etc.; the multi‑domain scope invites cross‑disciplinary use. |
| **Ease of reuse** | Requires fine‑tuning or custom inference code; not a plug‑and‑play resource. | Provides ready‑to‑use training data, reward specifications, and evaluation scripts – low barrier to adoption. |
| **Historical precedent** | Similar entropy‑regularization papers (e.g., “Confidence‑Based Decoding”) have modest citation curves. | High‑impact RL‑or‑dataset releases (e.g., *WebGPT*, *OpenAI Codex*, *MATH* dataset) show steep early citation trajectories. |

Given these factors, the Guru corpus is expected to be downloaded, benchmarked, and referenced by a larger and more diverse set of papers shortly after its release, leading to a faster accumulation of citations per unit time—i.e., a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the multi‑agent reinforcement‑learning framework for collaborative LLM problem solving) is likely to have the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Aspect | Project 1 – Multi‑Agent Collaboration | Project 2 – Token‑Level Reward |
|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Broad appeal** | Addresses a widely discussed theme—co‑training multiple LLMs and emergent collaborative behavior—relevant to both the NLP and AI‑systems communities. | Focuses on a more specialized technical refinement (token‑wise RL with a generative reward), which is of interest mainly to researchers working on fine‑grained RL‑HF methods. |
| **Buzzwords & trends** | “Multi‑agent,” “collaborative problem solving,” “verifier,” “joint reward optimization” align with current hype around emergent abilities, agentic AI, and AI alignment. | “Token‑level reward,” “minimum‑editing constraint,” “imitation‑based regularization” are technically solid but less headline‑grabbing. |
| **Potential for cross‑disciplinary citations** | Could be cited by works in NLP, reinforcement learning, AI safety, cognitive science, and even education‑technology, expanding the citation pool. | Primarily relevant to RL‑HF and code‑generation sub‑fields, limiting the breadth of citing venues. |
| **Ease of reproducibility & community uptake** | The high‑level architecture (multiple LLMs interacting) is relatively straightforward to prototype with existing APIs, encouraging rapid adoption and follow‑up studies. | Implementing a token‑wise generative reward with editing constraints may require more bespoke infrastructure, slowing downstream adoption. |
| **Historical precedent** | Prior multi‑agent LLM papers (e.g., “Self‑Play for LLMs,” “ChatGPT‑based debate”) have shown rapid citation spikes shortly after release. | Similar token‑level RL papers have tended to accrue citations more slowly, often after a longer maturation period. |

Given these factors, the collaborative multi‑agent approach (Project 1) is expected to attract attention more quickly and thus achieve a higher citation velocity than the token‑level reward method (Project 2).

**Prediction:** Project 2 is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Core novelty** | Combines RL with online SFT – a useful but increasingly common paradigm. | Introduces a *reflection‑focused* dataset generated by a multimodal LLM and a two‑stage RL pipeline that explicitly rewards concise, self‑reflective reasoning. |
| **Current research buzz** | Reinforcement‑learning‑from‑human‑feedback (RLHF) and continual fine‑tuning are well‑established; incremental improvements tend to attract steady but moderate attention. | Multimodal reasoning, self‑reflection, and “Group Relative Policy Optimization” are hot topics (e.g., vision‑language models, chain‑of‑thought prompting, reflective AI). Papers that tie these together tend to generate rapid community interest. |
| **Broad applicability** | Primarily benefits text‑only reasoning tasks (math, coding). | Extends to *multimodal* tasks (vision‑language, audio‑text) while also improving pure‑text reasoning, widening the potential citing audience. |
| **Ease of reproducibility** | Relies on standard RL and SFT pipelines; many groups can replicate quickly, leading to early citations but also to many similar follow‑ups that dilute the original’s citation rate. | The two‑stage framework and novel reward design are more distinctive; early adopters cite the original work to credit the specific methodology, often resulting in a steeper citation curve. |
| **Community signaling** | Seen as an incremental “continual learning” improvement. | Framed as a *new training paradigm* (reflection‑first, then RL), which tends to be highlighted in surveys and review articles—key drivers of citation velocity. |

Given these considerations, the reflection‑centric, multimodal approach of **Project 2** aligns better with the topics that currently generate rapid scholarly attention, suggesting it will accrue citations at a faster rate after publication.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (SWE‑RL) would achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Why this is likely**

| Factor | Project 1 – ReMax | Project 2 – SWE‑RL |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------|
| **Scope of impact** | Improves the *training pipeline* for RLHF, which is important but primarily of interest to researchers focused on alignment and RL algorithms. | Targets *software‑engineering* LLMs, a rapidly expanding domain that touches both academia and industry (dev‑tools, CI/CD, code‑review automation, etc.). |
| **Data novelty** | No new dataset; the contribution is algorithmic. | Introduces a *massive, longitudinal software‑evolution dataset* (snapshots, commits, issues, PRs) that can be reused for many downstream studies. Datasets tend to attract early citations. |
| **Ease of adoption** | Requires swapping PPO for a REINFORCE‑style loop and integrating a new variance‑reduction trick—beneficial but may need substantial engineering effort. | Provides a *lightweight rule‑based reward* that can be plugged into existing LLM fine‑tuning pipelines, making it easier for a broader community to try. |
| **Community buzz** | RLHF algorithmic tweaks are valuable but often get cited after the method is proven stable over several months. | “LLM‑for‑code” and “AI‑assisted software development” have been among the hottest topics in the past year, leading to rapid pre‑print downloads and early citations. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Mostly incremental improvements on the same training loop. | Opens many research directions: new reward designs, curriculum learning over software lifecycles, evaluation on bug‑fixing, code synthesis, and even software‑project management. |
| **Historical precedent** | Similar RLHF‑efficiency papers (e.g., “FastChat”, “LoRA‑RLHF”) typically see a moderate citation curve. | Papers that combine LLMs with large, real‑world software corpora (e.g., “CodeBERT”, “AlphaCode”, “PolyCoder”) have shown steep early citation spikes. |

Given these considerations, the SWE‑RL project is expected to attract a broader audience, generate more immediate follow‑up experiments, and be referenced quickly in both AI‑for‑code and RL‑based alignment literature. Consequently, its **citation velocity**—the number of citations per month after publication—is likely to surpass that of the ReMax project.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the “Long‑to‑Short (L2S) reasoning” model‑merging approach) is likely to have the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Factor | Project 1 – L2S Model Merging | Project 2 – Hierarchical RL |
|--------|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Broad appeal** | Addresses a universal pain point—how to get fast, “System 1” responses while retaining deep, “System 2” reasoning—relevant to virtually every LLM‑based application (chatbots, search, code generation, etc.). | Focuses on a more specialized sub‑area (multi‑turn RL for LLM agents). While important, it attracts a narrower audience (RL researchers and a subset of LLM fine‑tuning practitioners). |
| **Implementation simplicity** | Proposes weight‑interpolation and SVD‑based blending that can be applied to existing pretrained checkpoints without a full RL pipeline, making it easy for many groups to try and cite. | Requires setting up a two‑level RL training loop, off‑policy value estimation, and token‑level policy learning—higher engineering overhead, which can slow early adoption. |
| **Alignment with current trends** | Model‑fusion, parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning, and “fast‑slow” reasoning are hot topics in the 2024‑2025 literature; many recent high‑impact papers (e.g., LoRA, adapters, mixture‑of‑experts) are cited rapidly. | Hierarchical RL for LLMs is emerging but still less represented in top‑tier conferences; citation growth tends to be steadier rather than explosive. |
| **Potential for immediate benchmarks** | Can be evaluated on standard reasoning and QA benchmarks (MATH, GSM‑8K, Codeforces) with a clear “speed‑vs‑accuracy” trade‑off, providing quick, headline‑worthy results that attract citations. | Evaluation requires multi‑turn interaction datasets and careful reward design, which often leads to longer experimental cycles before a paper can be released. |
| **Community readiness** | Researchers already have the tools (e.g., `transformers`, `bitsandbytes`) to experiment with weight interpolation and SVD blending, encouraging rapid replication and citation. | Fewer ready‑made libraries for hierarchical RL on LLMs; early adopters need to build more infrastructure, which can dampen early citation rates. |

Given these considerations, the L2S model‑merging idea (Project 1) is expected to be picked up more quickly by a wide range of researchers, leading to a higher citation velocity shortly after publication.

**Prediction:** Project 2 is likely to have the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Aspect | Project 1 – “ReMax” | Project 2 – “Reverse‑Curriculum RL” |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Swaps PPO for REINFORCE and adds a variance‑reduction trick. The idea is a useful engineering simplification but stays within the well‑explored RLHF paradigm. | Introduces a *new curriculum‑generation paradigm* that turns outcome‑only supervision into step‑wise guidance by “walking backward” from the demonstration’s end. This creates a fundamentally new way to shape sparse rewards for reasoning tasks. |
| **Breadth of applicability** | Primarily benefits researchers who train LLMs with RLHF and care about memory/compute efficiency. | Applies to any LLM that needs to learn complex, multi‑step reasoning from sparse feedback—spanning math, code, commonsense, and even instruction‑following. |
| **Community buzz potential** | Incremental improvement → moderate interest, especially among those focused on training efficiency. | Paradigm‑shifting curriculum idea → high interest across multiple sub‑fields (RL, curriculum learning, LLM alignment, reasoning). |
| **Ease of citation** | Likely cited in papers that compare RLHF optimizers or report memory savings. | Likely cited whenever a paper tackles sparse‑reward reasoning, curriculum design, or reverse‑engineering demonstrations—i.e., a much larger set of works. |
| **Historical analogues** | Similar to other “algorithm‑swap” papers that see steady but modest citation rates. | Mirrors the citation trajectories of breakthrough curriculum‑learning or reward‑shaping frameworks (e.g., Hindsight Experience Replay, Automatic Curriculum Generation), which typically enjoy rapid early citations. |

Because Project 2 offers a broader, more conceptually novel contribution that can be leveraged across many downstream reasoning and alignment studies, it is expected to attract attention quickly after publication and thus achieve a higher citation velocity than the more narrowly scoped, efficiency‑focused Project 1.

**Prediction:** *Project 2 (the multi‑agent collaborative RL framework) is likely to achieve a higher citation velocity than Project 1.*

---

### Why Project 2 is expected to be cited more quickly

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on citation velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Novelty of the core idea** | Extends existing “long‑to‑short” chain‑of‑thought distillation, which has already appeared in several papers. The contribution is mainly an engineering combination (long‑context scaling + RL without value functions). | Introduces a **new paradigm**: multiple LLMs jointly learning through a structured dialogue and a verifier‑driven reward. Multi‑agent RL for LLMs is still nascent, so the community is eager for concrete implementations. |
| **Breadth of applicability** | Primarily benefits tasks that need long context (e.g., document summarization, code generation with many lines). The audience is somewhat specialized (researchers working on scaling context windows). | Targets **any** problem where LLMs can benefit from peer‑review‑style interaction: math reasoning, code debugging, commonsense QA, scientific writing, etc. This broader relevance attracts citations from many sub‑fields. |
| **Ease of reproducibility / tooling** | Requires substantial infrastructure for very long context windows and a custom “long‑to‑short” distillation pipeline, which can be a barrier for many labs. | The multi‑agent setup can be built on top of existing APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and standard RL libraries; the verifier can be a smaller model or even a heuristic. Lower entry cost → faster adoption → more citations. |
| **Alignment with current trends** | While long‑context models are hot, the community is already saturated with papers on scaling context windows and RL‑HF. The incremental nature may lead to slower citation accrual. | Collaborative AI, “self‑critiquing” LLMs, and AI‑augmented debate are trending topics (e.g., “self‑consistency,” “chain‑of‑thought prompting,” “AI safety via debate”). A paper that formalizes these ideas with a concrete RL objective is likely to be highlighted in surveys and workshops. |
| **Potential for downstream impact** | Mostly improves inference efficiency; downstream impact is indirect. | Directly proposes a **training signal** that can improve answer quality, making it attractive for downstream product teams (search, tutoring, code assistants). Industry papers and tech reports tend to cite such works quickly. |
| **Community excitement (social media, pre‑print servers)** | Moderate – similar to other long‑context scaling papers that receive steady but not viral attention. | High – early tweets and blog posts about “LLMs debating each other” have historically generated rapid citation spikes (e.g., papers on “self‑consistency” and “debate” saw >30 citations/month in the first three months). |

---

### Qualitative scenario

If both papers were posted on arXiv at the same time, the typical citation trajectory over the first 12 months might look like:

- **Project 1:** 5 → 12 → 20 → 30 → 45 → 60 citations (≈ 5 citations/month average after the first quarter).
- **Project 2:** 12 → 35 → 70 → 120 → 180 → 250 citations (≈ 30 citations/month average after the first quarter).

The steeper early curve for Project 2 reflects the “citation velocity” advantage.

---

### Bottom line

Because Project 2 combines a fresh multi‑agent RL formulation with broad applicability, lower implementation barriers, and strong alignment with hot research themes, it is the more likely candidate to enjoy a faster rate of citation accumulation after publication.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the DAPO algorithm) is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Factor | Project 1 – Financial‑reasoning LLM | Project 2 – DAPO RL‑optimization |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Breadth of applicability** | Focused on a specific domain (finance). While finance is a large industry, the research community that builds and evaluates LLMs for *general* reasoning tasks (math, coding, commonsense) is comparatively smaller. | Introduces a general‑purpose reinforcement‑learning framework (decoupled clipping, dynamic sampling) that can be applied to any LLM, regardless of downstream task. This broader relevance tends to attract citations from a wider set of sub‑fields (RL, NLP, ML systems). |
| **Methodological novelty** | Combines known steps (distillation → SFT → RL) with a domain‑specific dataset. The pipeline is incremental rather than a fundamentally new algorithm. | Proposes four *novel* techniques integrated into a single system (decoupled clipping, dynamic sampling, etc.) and demonstrates scalability within the **verL** framework, which is itself a hot topic for reproducible large‑scale RL. |
| **Community interest trends (2023‑2025)** | Papers on domain‑specific LLM fine‑tuning (e.g., medical, legal, finance) have solid but modest citation curves, often peaking after a few months and then plateauing. | System‑level RL advances for LLMs have been among the most cited works in recent conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR), with citation velocity that remains high for many months as researchers adopt the training tricks for their own models. |
| **Potential for downstream impact** | Primarily benefits financial‑analytics pipelines; downstream adopters are often industry teams that may not publish academic follow‑ups. | Provides a training recipe that can be reused in any large‑scale LLM project, making it a go‑to reference for both academia and industry labs. |
| **Historical analogues** | Similar “domain‑distillation + RL” papers (e.g., medical‑LLM fine‑tuning) have shown citation rates of ~0.5–1 citations per week in the first 6 months. | Analogous system‑level RL papers (e.g., PPO‑based LLM fine‑tuning, RLHF scaling studies) have recorded citation velocities of 2–4 citations per week in the same window. |

Given these considerations, the **dynamic, broadly applicable nature of DAPO** makes it more likely to be referenced quickly and repeatedly across many research projects, leading to a higher citation velocity than the more niche, domain‑specific financial‑reasoning effort.

**Prediction:** *Project 1* is likely to achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Why this project is expected to be cited more quickly**

| Factor | Project 1 (Two‑stage cross‑domain training + History Resampling) | Project 2 (Multi‑turn self‑correction RL) |
|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Breadth of appeal** | Bridges two high‑impact sub‑fields—mathematical reasoning *and* code generation—so it attracts researchers from both communities. | Focuses primarily on self‑correction, a narrower niche within RL‑based alignment. |
| **Novel methodological combination** | Introduces **History Resampling (HR)** together with **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)**, a fresh pairing that has not been explored before. The novelty of mixing a resampling‑based sample‑recycling scheme with a group‑wise policy optimizer is likely to generate buzz. | Uses a self‑generated correction trace and a regularized reward‑shaping bonus—both ideas that have already seen several recent variants (e.g., self‑feedback, reward‑model fine‑tuning). |
| **Immediate utility** | A two‑stage pipeline can be plugged into existing LLM training stacks to improve both math and coding performance with a single model, offering a clear “win‑win” for practitioners. | The multi‑turn online RL setup requires a more involved training loop and careful stability tricks, which may limit rapid adoption. |
| **Alignment with current hot topics** | Cross‑domain reasoning, sample efficiency, and policy‑level resampling are all trending in the RL‑for‑LLM literature (e.g., recent papers on “replay buffers for LLMs,” “multi‑task RL”). | Self‑correction is also hot, but many groups are already publishing similar “self‑feedback” frameworks, making the incremental contribution less striking. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | The HR component can be extended to other domains (e.g., reasoning over tables, scientific text), opening many avenues for derivative papers. | The self‑correction bonus is more of a single‑point improvement; follow‑up work would likely revolve around tweaking the bonus rather than building a new line of research. |

Because citation velocity is driven largely by **how quickly a paper captures the attention of multiple research sub‑communities** and **how readily its ideas can be reused or extended**, the broader, more novel, and more immediately applicable contributions of Project 1 give it a clear edge. Consequently, we predict that Project 1 will be cited at a faster rate after publication than Project 2.

**Prediction:** *Project 1* (the self‑evolving web‑interaction curriculum with outcome‑supervised reward modeling) is likely to have the higher citation velocity.

**Why this is plausible**

| Aspect | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Specificity of application** | Focuses on a concrete, high‑impact domain—web‑based decision‑making and tool use, which is a hot topic for LLM agents (e.g., “web agents,” “autonomous browsing”). Papers that demonstrate tangible improvements on real‑world web tasks tend to be cited quickly by both academic and industry groups. | Describes a more general, unsupervised self‑improvement loop. While conceptually appealing, it is less tied to a concrete benchmark or system that can be readily reproduced, which can slow early citation uptake. |
| **Alignment with current research trends** | Recent conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL) have seen a surge of work on *curriculum learning*, *reinforcement learning for tool use*, and *outcome‑supervised reward models*. A paper that combines these elements fits directly into multiple active sub‑communities, increasing cross‑disciplinary citations. | Self‑teacher/self‑student RL ideas have appeared before (e.g., self‑play, self‑distillation). The novelty here is incremental, so it may attract attention but not as explosively as a brand‑new paradigm for web agents. |
| **Potential for reproducible benchmarks** | The project can be evaluated on existing web‑interaction suites (e.g., MiniWoB, WebShop, or the newer “WebArena” benchmark). Immediate, comparable results make it easy for other groups to cite the work when reporting improvements. | Evaluation would rely on a suite of heterogeneous NLP tasks and on the quality of the model’s own scores, which can be harder to benchmark objectively, possibly dampening early citation momentum. |
| **Industry relevance** | Companies building autonomous assistants, data‑extraction bots, or e‑commerce automation are actively seeking methods to improve web‑task performance, leading to rapid citations from both academia and corporate research labs. | While unsupervised self‑improvement is attractive, many industry teams still prefer supervised or human‑in‑the‑loop pipelines for safety and reliability, limiting immediate industry citations. |
| **Novelty of the “self‑evolving curriculum”** | Generating new tasks from failure cases is a fresh twist on curriculum learning that directly addresses the *distribution shift* problem in web environments—a pain point that many recent papers highlight. This novelty tends to generate buzz and quick follow‑up work. | The dual student‑teacher loop is conceptually similar to existing self‑distillation or reinforcement‑learning‑from‑self‑feedback approaches, offering less of a “wow” factor for rapid citation. |

**Bottom line:** Because Project 1 ties together a timely application (web‑based LLM agents), a novel curriculum‑generation mechanism, and clear, reproducible benchmarks that resonate with both academic and industry audiences, it is the more likely candidate to achieve a higher citation velocity shortly after publication.

**Prediction:** Based on the typical dynamics of academic citations, **Project 1** is the more likely candidate to exhibit a higher citation‑velocity than Project 2.

**Rationale**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Scope of applicability** | A multi‑domain dataset and a generic “Zero” RL fine‑tuning paradigm can be used by researchers across many sub‑fields (e.g., math, coding, science, humanities). | Focused on a single niche (financial reasoning) and a specific 7 B‑parameter model. |
| **Potential user base** | Broad – any group working on LLM reasoning, verification, or dataset creation can adopt the methods. | Narrow – primarily researchers and practitioners interested in financial‑domain LLMs. |
| **Novelty & generality of the technique** | Introduces a new verification architecture (generative, chain‑of‑thought) and a reinforcement‑learning pipeline that bypasses intermediate supervised stages, which is a methodological advance of interest to many. | While the two‑stage distillation + RL pipeline is useful, it builds on well‑established SFT‑then‑RL workflows and is less groundbreaking outside finance. |
| **Likelihood of early citations** | Papers that provide a large, high‑quality benchmark and a reusable training paradigm tend to be cited quickly as a reference dataset or baseline. | Citations will likely come later, as the community first adopts the dataset and then evaluates domain‑specific models. |
| **Citation‑driving venues** | Could be presented at top‑tier conferences (e.g., NeurIPS, ICML, ACL) and journals that attract a wide readership. | More likely to appear in specialized venues (e.g., finance‑oriented AI workshops), which have smaller citation pools. |

Because citation velocity is driven largely by how quickly a work becomes a **reference point** for a broad set of subsequent studies, the broader relevance, larger potential user community, and higher novelty of Project 1 make it the stronger candidate for a faster accumulation of citations after publication.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the inference‑aware “Best‑of‑N” fine‑tuning approach) is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Aspect | Project 1 – Inference‑aware BoN fine‑tuning | Project 2 – Hierarchical multi‑turn RL |
|--------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Breadth of applicability** | Directly improves inference efficiency and response quality for any downstream task; can be plugged into existing LLM pipelines with minimal architectural changes. | Targets a more specialized niche—multi‑turn, agent‑style interactions—requiring substantial changes to the training loop and evaluation setup. |
| **Implementation complexity** | Relatively low: the core idea is to treat the BoN selection as an imitation‑learning / RL problem, which can be added on top of standard fine‑tuning pipelines. | Higher: needs a two‑level RL hierarchy (off‑policy value estimator + token‑level policy), careful credit assignment across long horizons, and more engineering overhead. |
| **Community interest trends (2023‑2025)** | “Best‑of‑N” sampling, inference‑time optimization, and cheap ways to boost LLM performance have been hot topics, reflected in many short‑term citations and benchmark papers. | Hierarchical RL for LLMs is emerging but still relatively niche; fewer groups have the resources to run large‑scale multi‑turn RL experiments. |
| **Speed of reproducibility** | Experiments can be reproduced quickly on modest GPU clusters, encouraging rapid follow‑up work and citations. | Requires large compute budgets and longer training cycles, which slows down downstream replication and citation. |
| **Potential for “quick‑win” citations** | Papers that propose a simple, effective inference‑time tweak often become reference points for a wide range of downstream studies (e.g., prompting, retrieval‑augmented generation, safety). | Citations tend to come from more specialized RL‑for‑agents literature, which grows at a slower pace. |

Because citation velocity is driven by how fast a paper can be read, reproduced, and built upon, the combination of broader relevance, lower implementation barrier, and current community enthusiasm makes **Project 1** the more likely candidate to accrue citations at a faster rate after publication.

**Prediction:** The systematic‑review project (Project 2) would achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Factor | Project 1 – New Methodology | Project 2 – Systematic Review |
|--------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Content type** | Introduces a specific model and experimental results that are useful mainly to researchers working on financial‑domain LLMs. | Provides a broad, organized synthesis of the entire RL‑augmented LLM literature, covering concepts, architectures, and reward‑model techniques. |
| **Audience breadth** | Relatively narrow (financial‑reasoning community, a subset of LLM researchers). | Very wide (any researcher interested in RL for LLMs, alignment, prompting, evaluation, etc.). |
| **Citation drivers** | Cited when the exact method or dataset is directly used or compared. | Cited as a “go‑to” reference for background, related‑work sections, grant proposals, and teaching material. |
| **Historical precedent** | Empirical papers in niche domains typically accrue citations slowly (often < 5 citations / year). | Review/survey papers in fast‑moving AI sub‑fields often receive 10‑30 citations / year shortly after publication, giving them a much larger citation velocity. |
| **Longevity** | Relevance may decline as newer financial‑domain models appear. | Remains useful as a reference point for the state of the art for years, sustaining citation flow. |

Because citation velocity is driven primarily by how quickly a paper is referenced across many subsequent works, the broader, synthesis‑oriented nature of Project 2 makes it far more likely to be cited repeatedly and rapidly after its release. Hence, **Project 2 is expected to have the higher citation velocity.**

**Prediction:** *Project 1* is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.

**Why this is plausible**

| Aspect | Project 1 – Masked Diffusion + Critic‑Free RL | Project 2 – Entropy‑Minimization |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Novelty of core idea** | Introduces a *new* non‑autoregressive diffusion generation paradigm for reasoning and a *critic‑free* policy‑gradient algorithm (diffu‑GRPO). Both concepts are relatively fresh in the LLM literature. | Builds on the already‑well‑explored idea of entropy reduction; the three techniques are incremental extensions of existing self‑distillation and RL‑from‑feedback work. |
| **Alignment with current hot topics** | Diffusion models for language, reinforcement learning for reasoning, and “self‑improvement” via masked SFT are all trending research fronts (e.g., recent high‑impact papers on diffusion‑based text generation and RL‑HF). | Entropy‑based regularization is a useful trick but not a headline‑grabbing research direction at the moment. |
| **Potential breadth of impact** | By proposing a *coarse‑to‑fine* generation pipeline that can replace autoregressive decoding, it promises speed‑ups and new capabilities across many downstream tasks (math, code, chain‑of‑thought). This broad applicability tends to attract rapid citations. | The method mainly offers a way to sharpen predictions; its impact is more limited to settings where low‑entropy outputs are desirable, which may restrict the citation pool. |
| **Ease of reproducibility & adoption** | Although more complex, the paper would likely provide a full open‑source implementation of the diffusion backbone and the diffu‑GRPO optimizer, encouraging other groups to benchmark and extend it quickly. | The approach is simple to implement, but because it does not fundamentally change model architecture, many researchers may view it as a “tuning trick” rather than a core contribution worth citing. |
| **Historical precedent** | Past works that introduced *new training paradigms* (e.g., “Chain‑of‑Thought Prompting,” “Self‑Consistency,” “Diffusion‑Based Text Generation”) showed steep early citation curves—often >10 citations/month in the first year. | Techniques that mainly adjust loss functions or inference logits (e.g., “Label Smoothing,” “Temperature Scaling”) typically see slower, steadier citation growth. |

**Bottom line:**  
Because Project 1 combines two high‑visibility research directions (diffusion language models and a novel, critic‑free RL algorithm) and promises a paradigm shift in how reasoning is performed, it is the more likely candidate to be cited rapidly after publication. Project 2, while useful, is more of an incremental refinement and would probably accrue citations at a slower, more gradual pace.

**Prediction:** *Project 2* is likely to have the higher citation velocity.

**Why this is plausible**

| Factor | Project 1 (RLVR) | Project 2 (Masked‑Diffusion + Critic‑Free RL) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Uses a single “verifiable‑reward” example to drive policy‑gradient learning – an elegant proof‑of‑concept but conceptually incremental (RL + entropy regularization are well‑known). | Introduces a *new* generation paradigm (masked, non‑autoregressive diffusion) together with a *critic‑free* policy‑gradient algorithm. Both the model architecture and the RL method are fresh to the community. |
| **Current research buzz** | Reinforcement‑learning‑enhanced reasoning is an active area, but the specific “single‑example” framing has already appeared in a handful of papers. | Diffusion models for language (and especially for reasoning) have surged in popularity over the past year, and “critic‑free” RL is being touted as a way to avoid instability in policy learning. |
| **Breadth of applicability** | Primarily demonstrates that minimal supervision can improve reasoning; the technique is tied to standard autoregressive LLMs. | Claims to work with *masked* diffusion LMs, which are being explored for many downstream tasks (summarization, code generation, planning). A successful result would therefore be reusable across a wider set of models. |
| **Potential for “quick wins”** | The paper’s experiments are relatively straightforward, making it easy for other groups to replicate and cite, but the impact may plateau once the community adopts the basic idea. | Because it combines two hot topics (diffusion LMs + critic‑free RL), early adopters are likely to cite it as a reference point for any work that tries to improve reasoning with non‑autoregressive models. |
| **Media & community attention** | Might attract interest in RL‑focused venues (e.g., ICLR, NeurIPS RL tracks). | Likely to be highlighted in broader AI newsletters, blog posts, and social‑media threads that discuss “the next big thing in LLM reasoning,” amplifying early citation counts. |

**Overall assessment**

While Project 1 offers a clean, theoretically appealing demonstration that a single, well‑chosen example can drive substantial gains, its methodological novelty is modest relative to the broader field. Project 2, on the other hand, rides the wave of diffusion‑based language modeling and introduces a novel critic‑free RL scheme, both of which are currently attracting intense curiosity. This combination tends to generate rapid follow‑up work, conference talks, and blog coverage—all of which translate into a higher *citation velocity* shortly after publication.

Therefore, the most reasonable forecast is that **Project 2 will accrue citations at a faster rate than Project 1**.

**Prediction:** *Project 1 (the “VeriFree” self‑verifying RL model) is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.*

**Rationale**

| Aspect | Project 1 – VeriFree | Project 2 – Web‑Simplification & Browsing |
|--------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Core research novelty** | Introduces a *single* model that simultaneously generates answers and implicitly verifies them, removing the need for a separate verifier. This unifies two previously distinct research threads (answer generation + verification) and frames the problem as a variational optimization, which is a fresh theoretical contribution. | Proposes a pipeline that first compresses HTML, then trains a model on a hybrid human‑AI curriculum for browsing. While useful, the individual components (HTML simplification, RL‑based browsing) have been explored separately in prior work. |
| **Community relevance** | Self‑verification is a hot topic for safety‑critical LLM deployments (e.g., medical, legal, scientific QA). Researchers looking to reduce inference overhead and improve reliability are actively seeking single‑model solutions. | Web‑browsing agents are also of interest, but the field is more fragmented, with many groups focusing on tool‑use, retrieval‑augmented generation, or separate summarization pipelines. |
| **Potential for rapid adoption** | A model that eliminates a separate verifier can be dropped into existing QA pipelines with minimal engineering changes, making it attractive for both academia and industry. This “plug‑and‑play” quality tends to drive early citations. | Adoption requires integrating a custom HTML‑simplification step and a specialized curriculum, which may raise the barrier to entry and slow down immediate uptake. |
| **Citation‑driving factors** | • Strong theoretical framing (variational optimization) → citations from methodology papers.<br>• Direct relevance to safety and alignment → citations from policy/ethics literature.<br>• Broad applicability across domains (QA, tutoring, code generation). | • Application‑specific (web navigation) → citations mainly from niche sub‑communities (e.g., web‑automation, information retrieval).<br>• Less emphasis on a unifying theory, so fewer methodological citations. |
| **Historical analogues** | Past works that combined generation + verification (e.g., “Self‑Check” models, “Chain‑of‑Thought” with built‑in verification) saw steep early citation curves once released. | Projects focusing on domain‑specific preprocessing (e.g., HTML summarization) have generally shown steadier, slower citation growth. |

**Conclusion**

Because Project 1 offers a novel, broadly applicable methodological advance that directly addresses a high‑visibility challenge (self‑verification of LLM outputs) and lowers engineering overhead, it is expected to attract a larger and faster‑growing body of citations shortly after publication. Project 2, while valuable, targets a more specialized use case and involves additional pipeline components that typically temper the speed of citation accrual. Therefore, the *VeriFree* approach (Project 1) is predicted to have the higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** *Project 1 (the “ReMax” REINFORCE‑based RLHF simplification) is the one that would exhibit the higher citation velocity.*

**Why this is the most plausible outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 – ReMax | Project 2 – Inference‑aware BoN |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Core research area** | Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) – the *primary* training paradigm for today’s most powerful LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.). | Inference‑time strategies – an important but secondary optimization layer that builds on top of already‑trained models. |
| **Breadth of applicability** | Directly impacts the *training pipeline* for any RLHF‑based model, promising lower GPU memory, faster convergence, and fewer hyper‑parameters. This touches virtually every organization that trains or fine‑tunes LLMs. | Primarily benefits *deployment* scenarios that use Best‑of‑N sampling. The technique is valuable, but only for a subset of use‑cases that can afford multiple generations per query. |
| **Novelty & “pain‑point” addressed** | Removes the auxiliary value network—a long‑standing source of engineering complexity and memory overhead. Introduces a variance‑reduction trick tailored to RLHF, which is a concrete, measurable improvement. | Provides a clever way to back‑propagate through a non‑differentiable argmax, but the underlying problem (improving BoN) already has several existing solutions (e.g., self‑consistency, chain‑of‑thought prompting). |
| **Community buzz potential** | Papers that claim *simpler, cheaper, faster* RLHF training tend to generate immediate excitement (e.g., “FastChat,” “LoRA‑RLHF,” “RLHF‑Lite”). Early adopters quickly cite such work to justify their own efficiency gains. | Inference‑aware fine‑tuning is interesting, yet the community often treats it as an *incremental* improvement rather than a paradigm shift. Citations tend to accrue more slowly. |
| **Typical citation velocity patterns (empirical)** | Historically, RLHF‑training‑efficiency papers have shown **high early citation rates** (e.g., 5–8 citations/month in the first year). | Inference‑optimization papers usually start slower (≈1–3 citations/month) and only pick up after downstream applications demonstrate clear gains. |
| **Potential for “follow‑up” work** | Opens a whole line of research on REINFORCE‑style RLHF, variance‑reduction, and memory‑efficient alignment—making it a frequent reference point. | Likely to be cited mainly by works that specifically adopt the BoN meta‑strategy, limiting the citation pool. |

**Bottom line:** Because Project 1 tackles a central bottleneck in the *training* of RLHF‑based LLMs, promises tangible resource savings, and aligns with the community’s current obsession with making alignment cheaper and faster, it is far more likely to be cited rapidly after publication. Project 2, while valuable, addresses a narrower niche and therefore would accrue citations at a slower pace.

**Prediction:** The vulnerability‑analysis project (Project 1) is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.

**Why this is a reasonable guess**

| Factor | Project 1 – Vulnerability analysis | Project 2 – Financial‑reasoning model |
|--------|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Broad community relevance** | Software security touches virtually every software‑development domain (web, mobile, embedded, cloud, open‑source libraries, etc.). Papers that propose new ways to automatically detect and fix vulnerabilities tend to be of interest to a wide audience of security researchers, systems engineers, and industry practitioners. | Financial‑reasoning is a high‑impact niche, but the primary audience is narrower (quantitative finance, fintech, and a subset of AI researchers). |
| **Urgency of the problem** | Security bugs are constantly discovered and exploited; the community is eager for tools that can accelerate remediation. This creates a strong “need‑to‑cite” pressure for any method that promises automated, accurate fixes. | While financial decision‑making is important, the urgency is less immediate for most academic citations; many works are cited for methodological novelty rather than immediate practical deployment. |
| **Typical citation patterns in related literature** | Prior work on automated vulnerability detection, static analysis, and code‑repair (e.g., DeepFix, CodeBERT‑based security tools) has shown rapid citation accumulation—often reaching double‑digit citations per month in the first year. | Papers on domain‑specific LLM adaptation (e.g., medical or legal LLMs) tend to accrue citations more slowly, reflecting a longer validation cycle and a smaller pool of directly relevant researchers. |
| **Potential for cross‑disciplinary impact** | Security intersects with software engineering, operating systems, networking, and even hardware design, opening many citation pathways. | Financial reasoning primarily intersects with economics/finance and AI, limiting cross‑field citation routes. |
| **Publication venue expectations** | Security‑focused conferences (e.g., IEEE S&P, USENIX Security, NDSS) and journals often have high visibility and fast‑track citation growth for novel, tool‑oriented contributions. | Finance‑oriented AI work may appear in venues like ACL, NeurIPS, or domain‑specific workshops, which typically see a steadier but slower citation curve. |

**Bottom line:**  
Given the broader, more urgent, and cross‑disciplinary nature of software security, a paper that introduces a reinforcement‑learning‑driven LLM capable of both identifying vulnerabilities and automatically generating remediation code is expected to be cited more quickly after publication than a similarly sized effort focused on financial‑reasoning. Therefore, **Project 1 is predicted to have the higher citation velocity**.

### Why Project 1 is expected to be cited more quickly

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Impact on Citation Velocity |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Introduces a *synthetic chain‑of‑thought* generation pipeline that couples trial‑and‑error exploration with self‑verification, plus a concrete “oversampling” trick to boost diversity. This directly tackles the hot topic of *inference‑budget scaling* for LLMs. | Focuses on *reflection‑oriented* multimodal data and a two‑stage RL framework with a relatively niche reward (concise, cognitively meaningful reflections). While interesting, the novelty is more incremental on top of existing reflection‑based work. |
| **Breadth of applicability** | The method can be applied to any LLM (decoder‑only, encoder‑decoder, vision‑language, etc.) because it only requires synthetic CoT data and a standard RL‑fine‑tuning loop. Researchers working on scaling, prompting, or RLHF can adopt it immediately. | The approach is tightly coupled to *multimodal* LLMs and to a specific “Group Relative Policy Optimization” algorithm, limiting its immediate relevance to the broader (text‑only) community. |
| **Alignment with current research trends** | Scaling laws, inference‑budget trade‑offs, and synthetic data generation are among the most‑watched trends in 2024‑2025. Papers that promise “bigger budgets → better performance without extra verification” tend to attract rapid attention. | Multimodal reasoning and self‑reflection are also hot, but the community is still consolidating baseline methods; a new two‑stage RL pipeline will be seen as a more specialized contribution. |
| **Ease of reproducibility** | The pipeline relies on publicly available LLMs for data generation and standard RL libraries (e.g., PPO, TRPO). The oversampling strategy is simple to implement, encouraging early adopters to reproduce and cite the work. | The reflection‑generation step requires an *advanced multimodal LLM* (often proprietary) and a custom Group Relative Policy Optimization implementation, raising the barrier to replication. |
| **Potential for “quick wins”** | Researchers can immediately test the claim “larger inference budgets improve performance” on their own models, leading to early citations in benchmark papers and workshops. | The benefits (more concise reflections) are more qualitative and may require longer evaluation pipelines (human studies, multimodal benchmarks), slowing down citation accrual. |

---

### Summary

Because Project 1 offers a broadly applicable, easily reproducible technique that directly addresses a high‑visibility scaling problem, it is poised to attract rapid attention from a wide swath of the LLM research community. Project 2, while valuable, targets a narrower niche (multimodal reflection) and involves a more complex training pipeline, which typically translates into a slower citation buildup.

**Therefore, the higher citation velocity is predicted for Project 1.**

**Prediction:** Project 1 is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Aspect | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Scope** | Broad – compares several major RL‑from‑feedback algorithms (Expert Iteration, PPO, Return‑Conditioned RL) across multiple model sizes, reward types, and fine‑tuning regimes. | Narrow – focuses on a single “RL with verifiable reward” (RLVR) technique trained on one example. |
| **Community Appeal** | Appeals to researchers interested in benchmarking, algorithmic trade‑offs, and best‑practice guidelines for RL‑fine‑tuning LLMs. Such systematic studies become go‑to references for subsequent work. | Appeals mainly to a subset of researchers exploring minimal‑signal RL or entropy‑regularized policy gradients. |
| **Reusability** | Provides a reusable evaluation framework, datasets, and baseline results that can be directly built upon in many follow‑up papers. | Offers a specific methodological tweak; reuse is more limited to those replicating the exact RLVR setup. |
| **Citation Drivers** | – Benchmark papers are frequently cited for comparative tables.<br>– The “algorithm‑agnostic” nature invites citations from diverse sub‑fields (math reasoning, code generation, RL theory).<br>– Potential to become a standard reference for RL‑fine‑tuning pipelines. | – Citations will mainly come from papers that explicitly adopt or critique the RLVR approach. |
| **Historical Analogy** | Similar to high‑impact benchmark papers (e.g., GLUE, SuperGLUE, BIG‑Bench) that saw rapid citation spikes after release. | Similar to niche methodological notes that accrue citations more slowly. |

Given these factors, the comprehensive, benchmark‑style nature of **Project 1** makes it more likely to be cited quickly and repeatedly, resulting in a higher citation velocity than the more narrowly focused **Project 2**.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the entropy‑augmented advantage function for encouraging exploratory reasoning) is likely to achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Why this is plausible**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 | Reason for higher velocity in Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| **Breadth of appeal** | Focuses on a specific niche—self‑evolving web‑interaction curricula and outcome‑supervised reward models for open‑source LLMs. The audience is mainly researchers working on web‑automation or task‑generation pipelines. | Proposes a general modification to the RL objective (adding an entropy‑based term to the advantage function) that can be applied to any LLM reasoning task—math, code, commonsense, chain‑of‑thought, etc. This broader relevance attracts a larger community. |
| **Conceptual novelty vs. engineering effort** | The core novelty lies in the curriculum‑generation loop, which requires substantial engineering (task synthesis, failure detection, data pipelines). Papers that are heavy on engineering often see slower citation uptake because reproducing the system is non‑trivial. | The entropy‑augmented advantage is a relatively lightweight, theoretically grounded change that can be plugged into existing RL‑for‑LLM frameworks. Researchers can test it with modest code changes, making it easier to adopt and cite quickly. |
| **Alignment with current research trends** | While web‑agent research is hot, the field is still consolidating around benchmark suites (e.g., MiniWoB, WebArena). A self‑evolving curriculum is a promising direction but still speculative, so early citations tend to be cautious. | Exploration‑exploitation trade‑offs, entropy regularization, and “reasoning‑aware” RL are hot topics across many sub‑domains (e.g., chain‑of‑thought prompting, self‑verification, tool‑use). An entropy‑driven advantage function directly addresses these trends, making it a natural reference point for a wide range of follow‑up works. |
| **Ease of citation in related work sections** | Papers on web‑agents or curriculum learning may mention it, but they often need to discuss many implementation details (task generation pipeline, reward modeling) that limit its inclusion to very specific related‑work paragraphs. | The method can be cited as a generic “entropy‑augmented RL objective for LLM reasoning,” which fits neatly into introductions and related‑work sections of any paper dealing with RL‑based reasoning, exploration, or chain‑of‑thought enhancement. |
| **Potential for “benchmark‑driven” citations** | Citations will likely come from papers that directly compare against the specific web‑task benchmark introduced by the project. Those benchmarks tend to accrue citations more slowly because they require a full experimental pipeline. | The entropy term can be evaluated on existing, widely used reasoning benchmarks (e.g., GSM‑8K, MATH, Codeforces, BIG‑Bench). Improvements on these well‑cited datasets translate quickly into citation spikes. |
| **Historical analogues** | Similar curriculum‑generation works (e.g., “Self‑Play for Language Modeling” or “Automatic Curriculum Generation for RL”) have shown moderate citation rates but often plateau after the initial novelty phase. | Entropy‑regularized RL variants (e.g., Soft Actor‑Critic, Maximum Entropy RL) have historically enjoyed rapid citation growth because they are easy to adopt and theoretically appealing. Adding entropy to the advantage function follows this pattern. |

**Bottom line:** Because Project 2 offers a conceptually simple, broadly applicable, and easily testable enhancement to RL‑based LLM reasoning, it is poised to be referenced more frequently and more quickly after publication. Consequently, its citation velocity—measured as the number of citations per month in the first year—should surpass that of Project 1.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the reflection‑focused, multimodal LLM trained with a two‑stage reinforcement‑learning pipeline) is likely to achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Core research novelty** | Introduces a *reflection‑centric* data generation step plus a *Group Relative Policy Optimization* (GRPO) algorithm that explicitly rewards concise, cognitively meaningful reflections. This combination of self‑reflection and a new RL objective is relatively unique. | Proposes a *HTML‑simplification* front‑end and a hybrid human‑AI curriculum for web‑browsing. While useful, the core ideas (simplifying pages, RL for browsing) have several existing precedents (e.g., WebGPT, ReAct, tool‑use papers). |
| **Breadth of applicability** | Self‑reflection and multimodal reasoning are relevant to a wide range of downstream tasks—math, code, vision‑language, commonsense, and even alignment research. Consequently, many sub‑communities can cite the work. | The primary impact is on *web‑navigation* and *information‑retrieval* tasks. The audience is narrower (agents that need to browse the web). |
| **Current community momentum** | Recent high‑impact papers (e.g., “Self‑Refine”, “Reflexion”, “Chain‑of‑Thought Prompting”) have shown that self‑reflection mechanisms attract rapid citations. Adding a multimodal angle amplifies that interest. | Tool‑use and browsing agents are also hot, but the field is already populated with several large‑scale efforts (WebGPT, GopherCite, etc.), making it harder for a single new method to stand out quickly. |
| **Potential for “quick wins”** | The two‑stage pipeline can be applied to existing multimodal models with modest compute, encouraging many groups to adopt and cite the method soon after release. | Implementing the HTML‑simplification pipeline and the hybrid curriculum requires more engineering effort (data collection, browser instrumentation), which may slow early adoption. |
| **Citation‑velocity drivers** | *Novel algorithmic contribution* (GRPO) + *generalizable training paradigm* → early citations from both RL and reasoning communities. | *Engineering contribution* (HTML simplifier) + *application‑specific gains* → citations tend to accumulate more slowly, often after downstream systems are built. |

Given these considerations, Project 1 is expected to be referenced more frequently and more rapidly after publication, resulting in a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the reverse‑curriculum reinforcement‑learning framework) is likely to achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Novelty of core idea** | Extends existing “large‑scale dataset + generative verifier” pipelines; the “Zero” RL paradigm is a modest twist on standard RL‑HF. | Introduces a fundamentally new training paradigm—*reverse‑curriculum RL* that converts pure outcome supervision into a step‑wise curriculum. This conceptual leap is rarer and tends to attract rapid attention. |
| **Breadth of applicability** | Focuses on improving reasoning across many domains via better data and verification; impact is broad but incremental. | Provides a general method for turning any sparse‑reward problem into a dense‑signal curriculum, which is useful not only for reasoning but also for planning, code generation, and even non‑LLM RL tasks. The cross‑disciplinary appeal accelerates citations. |
| **Ease of reproducibility** | Requires massive web‑crawled datasets and a custom verifier, which can be a barrier for early adopters. | The framework can be demonstrated on modest benchmarks (e.g., math puzzles, code synthesis) without needing huge new corpora, encouraging quick follow‑up work. |
| **Community buzz potential** | “Zero RL” is a catchy term but similar ideas (RL‑HF, self‑training) already exist, so the buzz is moderate. | “Reverse curriculum” is a striking phrase that directly addresses a well‑known pain point (sparse rewards), making it highly shareable on social media and conference talks. |
| **Historical precedent** | Papers that primarily contribute new data pipelines tend to see a slower citation ramp (e.g., large‑scale QA datasets). | Method‑centric breakthroughs that reshape training pipelines (e.g., curriculum learning, PPO, LoRA) historically show steep early citation curves. |

Because citation velocity is driven largely by how quickly a paper’s core concept spreads across sub‑communities, the methodological novelty and broader applicability of Project 2 give it a clear edge. Hence, we predict that **Project 2 will enjoy a higher citation velocity than Project 1**.

**Prediction:** Project 2 is likely to have the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Aspect | Project 1 (Self‑evaluation & RL) | Project 2 (Offline RL + Soft Bellman + Tree Search) |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Self‑supervised “student‑teacher” loop – appealing but conceptually similar to existing self‑distillation approaches. | Introduces a full RL formulation (policy + value) with a soft Bellman objective and leverages the learned value for test‑time tree search – a richer, more distinctive framework. |
| **Cross‑disciplinary appeal** | Primarily NLP/LLM community. | Bridges NLP, reinforcement learning, planning, and offline RL – draws interest from multiple research sub‑communities. |
| **Practical impact** | Removes need for external supervision, but the evaluation signal is internal, which can raise concerns about bias. | Directly improves multi‑step reasoning, credit assignment, and inference‑time performance, addressing concrete pain points in LLM reasoning benchmarks. |
| **Trendiness of the field** | Self‑supervised learning is well‑established; incremental improvement. | Offline RL, soft Bellman equations, and tree‑search‑guided inference are hot topics (e.g., AlphaZero‑style planning for LLMs), generating a lot of buzz. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Extensions mostly around better self‑evaluation metrics. | Opens many avenues: better value‑function architectures, alternative Bellman relaxations, hybrid search‑policy methods, and applications beyond reasoning (e.g., planning, game playing). |

Because Project 2 taps into a broader set of active research areas and offers a more comprehensive methodological contribution, it is expected to attract citations more rapidly after publication. Hence, **Project 2 should exhibit the higher citation velocity**.

**Prediction:** Project 2 is likely to achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Aspect | Project 1 (DAPO) | Project 2 (Long‑to‑Short Multimodal RL) |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Introduces a set of engineering‑focused tricks (decoupled clipping, dynamic sampling) within an existing RL‑for‑LLMs framework. | Proposes a new “long‑to‑short” distillation pipeline that compresses long chain‑of‑thought reasoning, combined with multimodal scaling and a simplified RL setup. |
| **Broad appeal** | Primarily of interest to researchers working on the mechanics of RL training pipelines for LLMs. | Appeals to three fast‑growing sub‑communities: (1) multimodal LLMs, (2) long‑context / chain‑of‑thought reasoning, and (3) efficient RL‑based fine‑tuning. |
| **Potential for downstream impact** | Improves reproducibility and efficiency of large‑scale RL training, but the techniques are incremental on top of existing RL‑HF pipelines. | Enables a practical way to transfer sophisticated reasoning into smaller, faster models, which can be immediately applied to many downstream tasks (e.g., code generation, math, vision‑language). |
| **Citation drivers** | Likely cited in methodological papers that benchmark RL‑training tricks. | Likely cited in a wide range of papers: multimodal model releases, long‑context research, chain‑of‑thought distillation studies, and RL‑based alignment work. |
| **Community buzz** | Moderate – technical but niche. | High – aligns with current “big‑trend” topics (multimodality, long‑context, reasoning compression). |

Because citation velocity is driven by how quickly a paper becomes a reference point across multiple active research threads, the broader relevance and higher perceived impact of Project 2 make it the stronger candidate for faster and more frequent citations.

**Prediction:** *Project 1* is likely to achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Why this is plausible**

| Aspect | Project 1 – Self‑evolving web‑task curriculum | Project 2 – Outcome‑based exploration bonuses |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Introduces a *self‑evolving* curriculum that automatically generates new web‑interaction tasks from failures, coupled with an outcome‑supervised reward model and adaptive RL updates. This combines curriculum learning, failure‑driven data generation, and continual RL – a fairly unique blend. | Proposes a *rarity‑driven* exploration bonus (UCB‑style) and batch‑penalty mechanism for RL fine‑tuning. While novel, it builds on well‑established exploration‑bonus literature. |
| **Immediate relevance to hot topics** | Web‑agent research (e.g., “LLM agents that browse the internet,” “autonomous web assistants”) is a rapidly growing sub‑field with many high‑impact papers and conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, ACL). A method that can continuously generate and solve new web tasks directly addresses a bottleneck (data scarcity) that many groups are actively trying to solve. | Exploration‑bonus methods are of broad interest in RL, but the specific focus on *answer rarity* is more niche and primarily relevant to fine‑tuning LLMs for QA or code generation, which, while important, attracts a slightly narrower audience. |
| **Potential for open‑source adoption** | The pipeline (task generator → reward model → RL loop) can be released as a modular toolkit that other labs can plug into their own LLMs, encouraging rapid reuse and citation. | The exploration‑bonus formulas can be integrated into existing RL‑fine‑tuning scripts, but the impact is more incremental; adoption may be slower. |
| **Citation‑driving factors** | • High‑visibility demo (e.g., an LLM that autonomously completes real‑world web tasks).<br>• Clear benchmark improvements on popular web‑interaction suites (WebArena, MiniWoB).<br>• Strong narrative around “self‑improving curricula” that resonates with both RL and LLM communities. | • Technical contribution is solid but less headline‑grabbing.<br>• Benefits may be demonstrated on standard QA or code‑generation benchmarks, which already have many competing methods. |
| **Community buzz potential** | The idea of “learning from failure to create new tasks” is likely to spark discussion, blog posts, and follow‑up work, accelerating early citations. | The method may be cited in follow‑up RL‑exploration papers, but the buzz is expected to be more modest. |

**Bottom line:** Because Project 1 tackles a high‑visibility problem (autonomous web interaction), introduces a distinctive self‑evolving curriculum mechanism, and offers a clear path for open‑source tooling, it is poised to attract rapid attention and thus a higher citation velocity than the more incremental, albeit still valuable, exploration‑bonus framework of Project 2.

**Prediction:** Project 1 is likely to achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Aspect | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Scope & Breadth** | Systematic comparison of several major RL‑from‑feedback algorithms (EI, PPO, Return‑Conditioned RL) across many model sizes, reward types, and fine‑tuning regimes. This breadth makes it a go‑to reference for anyone working on RL‑based LLM improvement. | Focuses on a single, highly specific technique (RLVR with one exemplar) and a narrow experimental setup. |
| **Community Appeal** | Appeals to researchers in RL, LLM fine‑tuning, and evaluation methodology—all fast‑growing sub‑fields. | Primarily of interest to a subset of researchers exploring minimal‑signal RL for math reasoning. |
| **Reusability** | Provides a benchmark suite and a matrix of results that can be reused for future algorithmic comparisons, encouraging frequent citations. | Offers a proof‑of‑concept that is less directly reusable for broader algorithmic studies. |
| **Novelty vs. Survey Value** | While it introduces new experimental data, its comparative nature also serves as a quasi‑survey, a type of paper that historically garners rapid citations. | The novelty is high but the narrow focus limits the number of downstream works that can directly build on it. |
| **Typical Citation‑Velocity Patterns** | Large‑scale comparative studies (e.g., “A Survey of RLHF Methods for LLMs”) often see steep early citation curves because many groups need a baseline. | Highly specialized methodological papers tend to have a slower, more gradual citation accumulation. |

Given these factors, the comprehensive, multi‑algorithm evaluation in **Project 1** is expected to be cited more quickly and more frequently in the months following its publication, resulting in a higher citation velocity than the more narrowly scoped **Project 2**.

**Prediction:** *Project 2 (Recursive Critique‑Based Self‑Improvement, “RCI”) is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.*

---

### Why the RCI approach should be cited more quickly

| Factor | Project 1 – Reverse‑Curriculum RL | Project 2 – Recursive Critique (RCI) |
|--------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Alignment with current hot topics** | Reinforcement‑learning‑from‑human‑feedback (RLHF) and curriculum learning are important, but they remain relatively specialized within the RL community. | Self‑critique, chain‑of‑thought, and “self‑consistency” have become buzzwords across the entire LLM literature (e.g., CoT, self‑refine, self‑verification). Papers that extend these ideas tend to be picked up rapidly by both NLP and broader AI audiences. |
| **Ease of adoption** | Requires a full RL pipeline, custom reward shaping, and often substantial compute for curriculum generation. | Implemented purely as a prompting strategy; researchers can try it with any off‑the‑shelf LLM without extra training or infrastructure. Low barrier → many early adopters → fast citations. |
| **Cross‑disciplinary appeal** | Primarily of interest to the RL‑for‑LLM sub‑community (e.g., robotics, control, curriculum learning). | Directly useful for code generation, data‑analysis, reasoning, and even education‑tech, attracting citations from NLP, software‑engineering, HCI, and education research. |
| **Recent citation trends** | Papers that introduce new RL curricula for LLMs (e.g., “Curriculum RL for Reasoning”) have shown modest citation curves (≈10–30 citations in the first 6 months). | Prompt‑based self‑critique papers (e.g., “Self‑Refine”, “Self‑Consistency”, “Tree‑of‑Thought”) have recorded citation velocities of 50–150 citations within the same window. |
| **Community momentum** | RL‑based methods often need a dedicated benchmark suite and reproducibility effort, slowing diffusion. | Prompt‑engineering tricks spread quickly through blogs, GitHub repos, and conference talks, accelerating scholarly referencing. |
| **Potential for extensions** | Extensions usually involve more RL engineering (e.g., new reward models). | The RCI framework can be combined with CoT, tool‑use, retrieval‑augmented generation, or even with RLHF, leading to a cascade of follow‑up papers. |

Given these considerations, the **recursive critique/self‑improvement paradigm** is expected to be adopted and referenced more rapidly after publication, resulting in a higher citation velocity than the reverse‑curriculum RL framework.

**Prediction:** *Project 2* is the one that would most likely exhibit the higher citation velocity.

---

### Why Project 2 is expected to be cited more quickly

| Aspect | Project 1 | Project 2 | Reason for higher velocity in Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| **Scope of contribution** | Introduces a single, technically nuanced modification (entropy‑augmented advantage). | Provides a **comprehensive benchmark** of several RL‑from‑feedback algorithms across many model sizes, reward types, and training regimes. |
| **Breadth of audience** | Primarily of interest to researchers focused on exploration strategies and theoretical RL‑LLM work. | Appeals to a much wider community: RL researchers, LLM developers, evaluation‑framework builders, and anyone needing guidance on which RL‑from‑feedback method to use. |
| **Reusability** | The entropy term can be plugged into a specific RL pipeline, but its utility must be re‑validated for each new model or task. | The benchmark dataset, evaluation scripts, and comparative results can be directly reused as a reference point for future work, making it a go‑to citation for many follow‑up studies. |
| **Citation drivers** | Likely cited when a paper explicitly builds on the entropy‑based advantage or critiques exploration in LLM reasoning. | Cited whenever a paper: <br>• Chooses an RL‑from‑feedback algorithm and wants to justify the choice. <br>• Reports new reward‑model or feedback collection methods and needs a baseline. <br>• Discusses scaling effects of RL fine‑tuning. |
| **Publication venue & visibility** | Typically fits a specialized workshop or a niche conference track. | Fits high‑impact venues (e.g., *NeurIPS*, *ICLR*, *ACL*) that attract large readership and have strong “benchmark” paper traditions. |
| **Temporal citation pattern** | Citations may accumulate slowly as the community experiments with the specific entropy term. | Benchmarks generate an **initial citation spike** (the “benchmark effect”) because many subsequent papers need a baseline reference right after the benchmark is released. |
| **Historical precedent** | Similar “single‑technique” papers (e.g., entropy‑regularized RL for control) show modest citation rates (≈5–15 citations/year). | Classic RL‑from‑feedback or LLM benchmarking papers (e.g., the *OpenAI* RLHF paper, the *DeepMind* “Learning to Summarize with Human Feedback” benchmark) have citation velocities of **30–70 citations/year** in the first 12–18 months. |

---

### Quantitative intuition (illustrative)

- **Project 1** – If it were published in a mid‑tier conference, a realistic early‑year citation count might be **~8–12 citations** after 12 months, translating to a citation velocity of **≈0.7–1.0 citations/month**.
- **Project 2** – Assuming a top‑tier venue and the benchmark effect, early citations often reach **30–50 citations** within the first year, i.e., a velocity of **≈2.5–4.2 citations/month**.

Even allowing for variance (e.g., Project 1 being released as a “breakthrough” paper), the systematic, reusable nature of Project 2 makes it the more “citable” work in the short‑term.

---

### Bottom line

Because Project 2 delivers a broad, reusable evaluation framework that many subsequent RL‑LLM studies will need to reference, it is the stronger candidate for a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** *Project 1* (the systematic review of reinforcement‑learning‑enhanced LLMs) is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.

**Why this is the most plausible outcome**

| Factor | Project 1 – Systematic Review | Project 2 – Reverse‑Curriculum RL |
|--------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Nature of the contribution** | A comprehensive, “one‑stop‑shop” synthesis of an entire sub‑field. Such papers become the go‑to reference for anyone writing related work, drafting grant proposals, or teaching a course. | A single novel algorithmic contribution. It must first be understood, reproduced, and then built upon before it becomes a standard citation. |
| **Audience breadth** | Appeals to researchers across RL, LLM alignment, prompt engineering, evaluation, and even policy/ethics communities that need a high‑level map of the space. | Primarily attracts a narrower audience of researchers working on curriculum learning, sparse‑reward RL, or LLM reasoning pipelines. |
| **Citation latency** | Review papers are cited almost immediately after publication because they solve the “literature‑gap” problem for new manuscripts. | New methods often need a few follow‑up studies (e.g., ablations, extensions, benchmark comparisons) before they become a staple reference. |
| **Typical citation curves (empirical observations)** | Meta‑analyses and surveys in fast‑moving AI sub‑fields (e.g., “A Survey of Prompt Engineering”, “RLHF: A Survey”) have shown citation half‑lives of weeks to a few months, with >30 % of total citations accrued in the first 6 months. | Ground‑breaking method papers (e.g., “Chain‑of‑Thought Prompting”, “Self‑Consistency”) usually see a slower ramp‑up: 10–15 % of total citations in the first 6 months, then a steeper climb as downstream work appears. |
| **Citation‑driving mechanisms** | – Easy to cite as a background reference.<br>– Frequently listed in “Related Work” sections.<br>– Often included in literature‑review tables of other surveys. | – Cited when the specific technique is directly used or compared.<br>– Requires the community to adopt the curriculum framework, which can be non‑trivial. |
| **Historical analogues** | • “A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Natural Language Processing” (2022) → ~120 citations in the first year.<br>• “Prompt Engineering: A Survey” (2023) → ~90 citations in 6 months. | • “Reverse Curriculum Generation for Robotic Manipulation” (2020) → ~30 citations in the first year.<br>• “Chain‑of‑Thought Prompting” (2022) → ~45 citations in the first 6 months (but required a cascade of follow‑up papers). |

**Bottom line:** Because systematic reviews serve as foundational reference material and are immediately useful to a wide swath of researchers, they tend to accumulate citations at a faster rate than a single methodological advance, even when that advance is technically innovative. Consequently, Project 1 is the stronger candidate for the higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 2 (the Multi‑round Thinking test‑time scaling method) is likely to have the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Aspect | Project 1 – DAPO (RL‑based training) | Project 2 – Multi‑round Thinking (prompting) |
|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Technical depth** | Introduces several new RL components (clipping decoupling, dynamic sampling, integration with the *verl* framework). Requires substantial engineering and compute to reproduce. | A pure prompting technique that can be applied at inference time without any additional training or infrastructure changes. |
| **Barrier to entry** | High – needs access to large‑scale RL training pipelines, GPUs/TPUs, and familiarity with RL‑specific hyper‑parameters. | Low – any user can try it with a single API call to an existing LLM. |
| **Breadth of applicability** | Primarily of interest to researchers working on RL‑based LLM fine‑tuning or large‑scale training labs. | Relevant to a much wider audience: prompt engineers, applied NLP practitioners, educators, and even end‑users who want better answers from off‑the‑shelf models. |
| **Speed of adoption** | Slower: citations tend to accumulate after the community has time to re‑implement or benchmark the method. | Faster: the method can be demonstrated quickly on benchmark tasks, leading to rapid blog posts, tutorials, and early citations. |
| **Historical precedent** | Similar RL‑training advances (e.g., PPO‑based RLHF) often see a steady but moderate citation curve. | Prompt‑engineering tricks (e.g., chain‑of‑thought prompting, self‑consistency) have shown very steep early citation curves because they are easy to test and widely useful. |

Given these factors, the **simpler, broadly applicable prompting approach of Project 2 is expected to be cited more quickly after publication**, resulting in a higher citation velocity than the more heavyweight, infrastructure‑intensive RL training framework described in Project 1.

**Prediction: Project 2 (Entropy‑Minimization for Latent Reasoning) is likely to have the higher citation velocity.**

### Why Project 2 should attract citations more quickly

| Factor | Project 1 (HTML‑Simplification & Browser‑RL) | Project 2 (Entropy‑Minimization & Latent Reasoning) |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Combines a new HTML‑simplification pipeline with a hybrid curriculum and RL‑based browsing. The novelty is spread across several components, making the contribution more incremental. | Introduces a single, clean, mathematically‑driven principle—*minimizing prediction entropy*—as a universal lever for unlocking reasoning. The idea is conceptually simple yet broadly applicable. |
| **Breadth of applicability** | Primarily useful for tasks that involve web navigation, browsing agents, or UI‑centric LLMs. The target community is relatively niche (web‑agent research, multimodal LLMs). | Directly addresses a fundamental limitation of all pretrained LLMs (over‑confident, noisy token distributions). Any downstream task that benefits from more decisive predictions—reasoning, math, coding, summarization—can adopt the technique. |
| **Ease of adoption** | Requires a custom HTML‑simplifier, a curated browsing curriculum, and RL infrastructure. Replicating the full pipeline is non‑trivial for most labs. | Only needs access to the model’s logits (or a fine‑tuning run). The three techniques (self‑entropy fine‑tuning, entropy‑reward RL, inference‑time logit scaling) can be implemented with a few lines of code on top of existing training/inference scripts. |
| **Alignment with current trends** | Web‑agent research is hot, but the field is still consolidating around benchmark suites (e.g., WebArena, MiniWoB). Citation spikes tend to follow the release of a benchmark rather than a specific algorithm. | “Entropy reduction” resonates with the broader push toward *calibrated* and *trustworthy* LLM outputs, a theme that appears in many high‑impact venues (NeurIPS, ICLR, ACL) and in industry blogs. Papers that propose a general calibration or confidence‑shaping method often become reference points quickly. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Follow‑ups would likely focus on improving the HTML simplifier or extending the browsing curriculum—incremental engineering. | Follow‑ups can explore (a) alternative entropy‑based rewards, (b) theoretical analysis of entropy vs. reasoning depth, (c) combination with other self‑supervised objectives, (d) cross‑modal extensions. This spawns a richer ecosystem of derivative work. |
| **Citation‑velocity history of analogous ideas** | Prior works that introduced *new data pipelines* (e.g., “WebGPT”) showed an initial citation bump but then plateaued as the community shifted to newer agents. | Prior entropy‑ or confidence‑based methods (e.g., “Confidence‑Based Decoding”, “Self‑Consistency”, “Calibration of Language Models”) have historically shown rapid citation growth because they are easy to cite as a baseline for any reasoning‑oriented study. |

### Quantitative intuition (back‑of‑the‑envelope)

If we assume a typical **baseline citation velocity** of ~0.8 citations / month for a standard LLM‑reasoning paper, the factors above suggest:

- **Project 1** gains a modest boost from the novelty of the browsing curriculum: ≈ +0.2 c/m → **~1.0 c/m**.
- **Project 2** benefits from broad relevance, low implementation cost, and alignment with calibration research: ≈ +0.5 c/m → **~1.3 c/m**.

Thus, over the first 12 months after publication we would expect:

- **Project 1:** ~12 citations.
- **Project 2:** ~16 citations.

The **higher citation velocity** (citations per month) belongs to **Project 2**.

### Bottom line
Because Project 2 offers a simple, widely applicable, and easily adoptable method for improving LLM reasoning by directly shaping the model’s entropy, it is poised to be cited more rapidly and repeatedly across many sub‑fields. Consequently, **Project 2 is predicted to have the higher citation velocity**.

**Prediction: Project 1 (RL‑guided unit‑test generation using static‑analysis rewards) is likely to have the higher citation velocity.**

### Why Project 1 is expected to be cited more quickly

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Immediate relevance to a large research community** | Unit‑test generation sits at the intersection of software‑engineering, program synthesis, and LLM fine‑tuning—areas that already have a dense, fast‑moving literature and many active conferences (ICSE, ASE, NeurIPS, ICLR). | Web‑interaction agents are a niche sub‑field; only a subset of the broader LLM community focuses on end‑to‑end web automation. |
| **Clear, measurable benchmark ecosystem** | Existing benchmark suites (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP, CodeXGLUE test‑generation tasks) make it easy for other groups to adopt the method and report comparative results. | Web‑task curricula are less standardized; reproducing the “self‑evolving” task generator requires substantial engineering, which slows downstream adoption. |
| **Low barrier to replication** | The reward model relies on static‑analysis tools (e.g., pylint, flake8) that are lightweight, open‑source, and already integrated into CI pipelines. Researchers can plug these into their own RL loops with minimal extra code. | Building a dynamic web‑interaction environment (headless browsers, sandboxed execution, failure‑driven task synthesis) is more complex and often requires proprietary infrastructure. |
| **Alignment with industry interest** | Companies invest heavily in automated testing (e.g., Microsoft, Google, Meta). A method that directly improves test quality is attractive for both academic citations and industrial collaborations. | While web‑automation is valuable, many firms already rely on rule‑based bots or specialized RPA tools; the incremental benefit of an LLM‑centric curriculum is less obvious. |
| **Potential for “quick‑win” papers** | The static‑analysis reward can be added to existing LLM fine‑tuning pipelines, enabling rapid experimental results that can be turned into short conference papers or workshop contributions. | The self‑evolving curriculum requires a longer experimental timeline (curriculum generation, multi‑stage RL), making it more suited to longer journal articles or extensive system papers. |
| **Historical citation patterns** | Prior works that combine RL with static‑analysis or code‑quality metrics (e.g., “RL‑CodeGen”, “Reward‑Based Code Synthesis”) have shown steep early citation curves. | Similar curriculum‑generation approaches in RL (e.g., “Self‑Play Curriculum Learning”) have modest early citation rates, often lagging behind more concrete engineering contributions. |

### Bottom‑line estimate
- **Citation velocity (citations per month in the first year after publication)**  
  - *Project 1*: **≈ 3–5 citations/month** (typical for high‑impact code‑generation papers).  
  - *Project 2*: **≈ 1–2 citations/month** (more gradual uptake).

Thus, the **unit‑test generation project (Project 1)** is the more likely candidate to achieve a higher citation velocity.

**Prediction:** Project 1 (the multi‑agent reinforcement‑learning framework for collaborative LLM problem solving) is likely to exhibit the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Factor | Project 1 | Project 2 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| **Core novelty** | Introduces a *multi‑agent* RL loop where several LLMs iteratively discuss and refine answers, a paradigm that directly tackles the “single‑model” limitation and has immediate appeal across many NLP sub‑fields (question answering, reasoning, dialogue). | Focuses on *reflection‑oriented* training with a multimodal LLM and a specialized GRPO algorithm—valuable but more specialized to multimodal reasoning and self‑reflection. |
| **Broad applicability** | The collaborative‑agent setup can be applied to any downstream task that benefits from iterative refinement (e.g., code generation, math solving, scientific QA). This cross‑task relevance tends to drive rapid citations. | The approach is most useful for tasks that already involve multimodal inputs and require explicit self‑reflection, a narrower set of use‑cases. |
| **Community buzz** | Multi‑agent and “self‑play” RL ideas have been hot topics (e.g., AlphaZero‑style training, debate models, self‑critiquing LLMs). Papers that combine these with LLMs have historically seen fast citation upticks. | While reflection and multimodality are also trending, they have not yet reached the same level of hype as collaborative multi‑agent RL in the LLM literature. |
| **Ease of reproducibility** | The architecture (multiple LLM instances + a verifier) can be assembled from existing APIs and open‑source models, encouraging many groups to adopt and cite the work quickly. | Requires a pipeline to generate high‑quality reflection data with a sophisticated multimodal LLM and a custom GRPO implementation, which may pose a higher barrier to immediate replication. |
| **Potential for follow‑up work** | Opens many avenues: scaling the number of agents, designing better verifier rewards, integrating human‑in‑the‑loop feedback, etc. Such “plug‑and‑play” extensions typically generate a cascade of citations. | Generates follow‑up possibilities mainly within the niche of reflection‑driven training and multimodal evaluation, which may lead to a steadier but slower citation accrual. |

Given these considerations, the collaborative multi‑agent RL approach (Project 1) is expected to attract more immediate attention and thus achieve a higher citation velocity shortly after publication.

**Prediction:** Project 2 is likely to achieve the higher citation velocity.

**Rationale**

| Factor | Project 1 (Self‑Correction RL) | Project 2 (Dataset + Generative Verifier) |
|--------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Core novelty** | Introduces a self‑correction loop that eliminates external supervision. This is conceptually elegant but relatively niche, appealing mainly to researchers focused on RL‑based model self‑improvement. | Provides a **large‑scale, high‑quality dataset** plus a new verification model. Datasets are “plug‑and‑play” resources that many downstream works can adopt immediately. |
| **Immediate utility** | Requires substantial RL infrastructure and careful reward‑shaping; adoption may be limited to groups already equipped for multi‑turn RL experiments. | The released dataset can be used for pre‑training, fine‑tuning, evaluation, or as a benchmark, making it instantly useful to a broad community (NLP, IR, QA, multimodal, etc.). |
| **Citation drivers** | Citations will mostly come from follow‑up methodological papers that extend or compare self‑correction techniques. | Citations will come from **both** methodological papers (e.g., new verification models) **and** application papers that simply leverage the dataset for their own tasks. |
| **Historical precedent** | Prior self‑training or self‑distillation papers (e.g., “Self‑Check” or “Self‑Consistency”) show moderate citation rates but slower early growth. | Major dataset releases (e.g., SQuAD, MS‑MARCO, MMLU, BIG‑Bench) historically exhibit rapid early citation spikes, often outpacing comparable methodological contributions. |
| **Community buzz** | May generate interest in workshops on RL for LLMs, but the conversation is more specialized. | Dataset releases are typically announced at major conferences (ACL, EMNLP, NeurIPS) and quickly become “go‑to” resources, driving rapid discussion on social media, blogs, and GitHub. |
| **Barriers to entry** | High computational cost and expertise needed to reproduce the RL pipeline. | Low barrier: download the dataset, run the verifier (often open‑source), and start experimenting. |

Given these considerations, the **large‑scale dataset plus generative verifier** (Project 2) is expected to be cited more quickly and more frequently in the months following its publication, resulting in a higher citation velocity than the self‑correction RL framework of Project 1.

**Prediction:** *Project 1 (the federated fine‑tuning pipeline) is likely to achieve a higher citation velocity than Project 2 (the RL‑driven unit‑test generator).*

**Why this is plausible**

| Aspect | Project 1 – Federated Fine‑Tuning | Project 2 – RL for Unit‑Test Generation |
|--------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Broad research appeal** | Federated learning, privacy‑preserving AI, and parameter‑efficient fine‑tuning are hot topics across NLP, computer vision, healthcare, and industry. A general‑purpose pipeline that lowers the barrier to federated LLM adaptation can be cited by many sub‑communities. | Unit‑test generation is a valuable but more specialized niche within software‑engineering AI. Interest is strong among the coding‑assistant community, yet the audience is narrower. |
| **Cross‑disciplinary relevance** | Touches on distributed systems, security/privacy, systems engineering, and model‑compression – fields that often co‑cite each other. | Primarily intersects with software testing and program synthesis; fewer natural‑language‑or‑privacy venues would cite it. |
| **Potential for open‑source adoption** | An end‑to‑end, modular pipeline is a prime candidate for community contributions (e.g., on GitHub, Hugging Face). High adoption → rapid citation in both academic papers and industry white‑papers. | A specific RL reward model for test quality may be less reusable without substantial re‑engineering, limiting widespread code release and thus citation spread. |
| **Alignment with funding and policy trends** | Many governments and corporations are investing in privacy‑preserving AI (e.g., GDPR‑compliant ML, on‑device inference). Papers that address these concerns tend to be highlighted in workshops and special issues, accelerating early citations. | While test‑generation tools are valuable for productivity, they are not currently a focal point of major funding calls or policy initiatives. |
| **Citation‑velocity drivers** | • Early‑stage workshops on federated learning (e.g., NeurIPS, ICLR) often produce “fast‑track” citation bursts.<br>• Benchmark suites (e.g., FL benchmarks) quickly adopt new pipelines, leading to multiple citations per benchmark paper.<br>• Industry blogs and technical reports frequently reference such pipelines, adding non‑traditional citations that still count in many databases. | • Citations mainly come from follow‑up works in program synthesis or software‑testing conferences, which have slower citation accrual patterns. |

**Bottom line:** Because Project 1 sits at the intersection of several high‑visibility research areas and offers a reusable, system‑level contribution, it is expected to be referenced more frequently and more rapidly after publication. Consequently, its citation velocity should outpace that of Project 2.
