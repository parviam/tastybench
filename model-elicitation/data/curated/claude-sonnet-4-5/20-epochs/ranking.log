# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2 (DAPO)

## Key Reasons

**1. Pragmatic Scope & Faster Time-to-Results**
- Project 2 has a well-defined, focused innovation (decoupled clipping + dynamic sampling)
- Project 1 is overly ambitious with multiple complex components (multi-modal, long-context, long-to-short transfer) that each require substantial research effort
- You'll likely publish and iterate faster with Project 2

**2. Reproducibility & Community Impact**
- Project 2's open-source commitment (code + dataset) maximizes research impact
- The verl framework integration means you're building on proven infrastructure
- Project 1's complexity makes reproducibility challenging, limiting adoption

**3. Scalability is Critical**
- "RL at scale" is the primary bottleneck in the field right now
- Project 2 directly addresses training stability and efficiency—the biggest pain points
- Project 1's long-context approach may actually harm scalability (compute/memory intensive)

**4. Lower Technical Risk**
- Project 2's innovations are orthogonal and can be validated independently
- Project 1 has multiple interdependencies where failure in one component (e.g., long-to-short transfer) could undermine the entire approach

**5. Market Timing**
- The field needs better training algorithms *now* (Project 2)
- Multi-modal reasoning with complex RL is still exploratory territory

## The Bottom Line

Project 2 offers a **higher probability of meaningful contribution** with **clearer validation metrics**. Project 1 reads like 3-4 separate research projects bundled together. Start with Project 2, and if successful, you can always incorporate multi-modal or transfer learning as follow-up work.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 1 (ReST)

## Why Project 1 is the Better Choice

**Project 1 offers significantly more research value and career impact** for the following reasons:

### 1. **Broader Applicability & Impact**
- ReST is a **general methodology** applicable across all domains (math, coding, reasoning, etc.)
- Your findings will be relevant to the entire AI research community
- Project 2 is narrowly focused on finance, limiting your audience and citation potential

### 2. **Novel Research Contributions**
- Offline RL for LLMs is still an active research area with open questions:
  - Optimal sampling strategies from initial policies
  - Dataset diversity vs. quality tradeoffs
  - Iteration dynamics in the ReST loop
- Project 2 is largely **engineering/application work** - combining existing techniques (distillation + SFT + RL) without methodological novelty

### 3. **Resource Efficiency**
- ReST's offline nature means **lower computational costs**
- No need for expensive domain expertise or specialized datasets
- Project 2 requires financial domain knowledge, curated datasets, and validation from finance experts

### 4. **Publication Potential**
- Project 1 targets top-tier ML venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)
- Project 2 would likely only fit domain-specific or application conferences
- General methodology papers have longer shelf-life and higher impact

### 5. **Clearer Success Metrics**
- You can benchmark ReST on established datasets (GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval)
- Financial reasoning evaluation is murky - what constitutes "strong financial reasoning"?

## The Bottom Line

**Choose Project 1** if you want to advance RL methodology and make contributions that matter to AI research broadly. Choose Project 2 only if you have specific domain expertise in finance or industry partnerships that make the application valuable.

For an AI researcher building their career, **Project 1 is the obvious choice**.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2 (ReST/Offline RL)

## Why Project 2 is the Better Choice

**Project 2 offers substantially more research value and practical impact.** Here's why:

### 1. **Actual Learning vs. Inference Tricks**
- **Project 1** is essentially a prompting strategy that provides marginal gains through iteration but teaches the model nothing new
- **Project 2** creates permanent improvements in the model's capabilities through learning, building compound value over time

### 2. **Research Novelty and Publication Potential**
- **Project 1**: Multi-round thinking/self-refinement has been extensively explored (Self-Refine, Reflexion, etc.). Incremental work here is crowded.
- **Project 2**: ReST-style approaches are still active research frontiers with open questions about sample efficiency, reward design, and scaling laws. More publishable insights await.

### 3. **Practical Scalability**
- **Project 1**: Multiply inference costs by N rounds—economically prohibitive at scale
- **Project 2**: One-time training cost that amortizes across all future inferences

### 4. **Skill Development**
Project 2 teaches you more valuable skills:
- RL algorithm implementation and debugging
- Dataset curation and filtering strategies  
- Reward modeling and preference learning
- Training pipeline optimization

### 5. **Impact on Math/Coding Specifically**
For your stated domains, **verifiable rewards** (test cases for coding, answer correctness for math) make Project 2 particularly effective. This is where offline RL truly shines—you can generate diverse solutions and learn from outcome-based feedback.

## The Caveat
Project 1 is faster to implement (days vs. weeks) and could serve as a useful **baseline** for Project 2. Consider using multi-round thinking to generate your initial dataset for ReST.

**Bottom line**: If you want meaningful research contributions and practical impact, Project 2 is the clear winner.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

## Why Project 2 is the stronger choice:

**1. Better positioned in the current research landscape**
- Project 1 resembles work that's already been extensively explored (OpenAI's o1, DeepMind's work on domain-specific RL)
- Project 2 tackles the cutting-edge problem of **inference-time compute scaling**, which is currently one of the hottest areas in LLM research
- The ability to improve performance by "thinking longer" without external verifiers is a key unsolved challenge

**2. More tractable scope**
- Project 1 requires building infrastructure across *multiple domains* with *domain-specific reward functions* - this is a massive engineering lift
- Project 2 has a clearer pipeline: synthetic data generation → pre-training → RL with oversampling
- You can iterate faster and demonstrate results sooner

**3. Stronger potential impact**
- Inference scaling without verifiers is more generalizable - it could work for open-ended problems where verification is hard/impossible
- Project 1's value depends heavily on the quality of domain-specific rewards, which may not transfer well
- The synthetic trial-and-error data generation in Project 2 could be valuable even as a standalone contribution

**4. Lower risk**
- Project 1 has high risk of being "scooped" by well-resourced labs already doing this
- Project 2's specific combination (synthetic CoT with trial-and-error + oversampling for diversity) is more novel

## One caveat:
If you have unique access to high-quality multi-domain data or reward signals that others don't, Project 1 becomes more attractive. Otherwise, **go with Project 2**.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

## Why Project 2 is the stronger choice:

**1. Novel theoretical contribution**
- Project 2 addresses a fundamental gap in RL for LLMs: the connection between entropy and *productive* exploration (reasoning steps) vs. mere uncertainty
- The insight that high-entropy tokens correlate with pivotal reasoning actions is empirically grounded and theoretically rich
- Project 1 is essentially process optimization—useful but incremental

**2. Broader applicability**
- Project 2's entropy-augmented advantage function can work with ANY RL training setup (PPO, DPO variants, etc.)
- It's orthogonal to inference strategies—you could even combine it WITH BoN later
- Project 1 locks you into the BoN paradigm, which may become obsolete as inference strategies evolve

**3. More compelling research narrative**
- "Teaching models to explore better reasoning paths" is more fundamental than "optimizing for a specific sampling strategy"
- Addresses the core challenge: how do we get models to discover complex reasoning chains?
- Project 1 solves a coordination problem between training and inference, but doesn't improve the model's intrinsic reasoning capability

**4. Publishability and impact**
- Project 2 offers clearer insights into *how* LLMs reason under RL
- Opens multiple research directions: analyzing which tokens should have high entropy, how entropy patterns differ across tasks, etc.
- Project 1 is more engineering-focused and harder to extract generalizable insights from

## Key risks to mitigate in Project 2:
- Ensure you can disentangle "good" high-entropy (reasoning pivots) from "bad" high-entropy (confusion)
- Need strong baselines showing entropy bonus outperforms naive exploration bonuses
- Must demonstrate it produces *valid* longer chains, not just verbose rambling

**Bottom line**: Project 2 pushes the science forward; Project 1 optimizes existing infrastructure.

# Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

## Clear Rationale

**Project 2 is the stronger choice** for several compelling reasons:

## 1. **Scientific Value & Impact**
- **Fills a critical knowledge gap**: The field desperately needs systematic comparisons of RL algorithms for reasoning. Current literature is fragmented with cherry-picked results
- **Broader applicability**: Your findings will inform the entire community's choice of training methods
- **Publication potential**: Comprehensive empirical studies comparing fundamental approaches are highly valued (think: papers like "Scaling Laws" or algorithm comparison studies)

## 2. **Risk Profile**
Project 1 is **high-risk**:
- Self-correction in LLMs is notoriously difficult; models often fail to improve or even degrade their answers
- "Behavior collapse" suggests you're already aware of failure modes
- Depends on successfully solving multiple hard problems sequentially (initialization + reward shaping)

Project 2 is **lower-risk, high-reward**:
- Building on established algorithms
- Even "negative results" (e.g., "PPO doesn't work well for math") are publishable and valuable
- Multiple experimental axes provide insurance—if one dimension fails, others may succeed

## 3. **Research Trajectory**
Project 2 **naturally leads to Project 1**:
- You'll understand which RL algorithms work best for reasoning
- You'll identify limitations that self-correction might address
- Your systematic evaluation will validate whether self-correction actually helps (using Project 2's methodology)

The reverse isn't true—Project 1 doesn't naturally inform broader algorithmic choices.

## 4. **Practical Execution**
- **Project 2**: Clear experimental matrix, well-defined comparisons, manageable scope
- **Project 1**: Vague success criteria ("effective correction behavior"), requires inventing new techniques while also validating them

## Suggested Path Forward

1. **Execute Project 2 first** (6-9 months)
2. **Use insights to refine Project 1** as a follow-up that addresses specific limitations you discover
3. This creates a natural two-paper sequence with compounding impact

**Bottom line**: Project 2 gives you a publishable contribution regardless of outcomes, builds essential knowledge, and positions you to tackle Project 1 from a position of strength.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue **Project 1**

## Key Reasoning

**Project 1 is significantly more impactful and novel**, while Project 2 is narrower in scope and faces serious methodological concerns.

## Why Project 1 is Superior

### 1. **Broader Impact & Generalizability**
- Works across *all domains* (math, coding, reasoning) vs. finance-only
- Addresses a fundamental challenge in AI: unsupervised improvement
- Much larger potential user base and research community interest

### 2. **Novel Research Contribution**
- Self-evaluation as reward signal is an active, high-value research area
- Tackles the core problem: "Can models reliably improve without external supervision?"
- Greater publication potential in top-tier venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)

### 3. **Technical Innovation**
- The alignment problem between self-assessment and actual quality is fascinating
- Opens questions about reward modeling, calibration, and avoiding reward hacking
- More intellectually challenging and publishable

## Critical Issues with Project 2

### 1. **Derivative Work**
- Heavily dependent on DeepSeek-R1's capabilities
- Essentially applying existing techniques to a vertical domain
- Limited novelty: "SFT + RL on distilled data" is well-trodden

### 2. **Questionable Market Fit**
- Finance firms typically want proprietary models with their own data
- 7B parameter models may be too small for production finance use
- Competitive landscape already crowded (Bloomberg GPT, FinGPT, etc.)

### 3. **Evaluation Challenges**
- Financial reasoning is hard to benchmark objectively
- Real-world finance requires regulatory compliance, risk management beyond LLM scope
- Limited academic benchmark datasets for rigorous evaluation

## Practical Considerations

**For Project 1**, focus on:
- Developing robust methods to prevent reward hacking
- Testing across diverse domains to prove generalizability
- Comparing against models trained with human feedback

**Risk mitigation**: Start with domains where self-assessment quality can be validated (math with verifiable answers) before generalizing.

## Bottom Line

Unless you have specific domain expertise in finance, strong industry connections, or proprietary financial datasets, **Project 1 offers better research impact, broader applicability, and more interesting technical challenges**. It's the clear choice for advancing your research career and contributing meaningfully to the field.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

## Why Project 2 is the Better Choice

**Project 2 directly addresses your stated goal** (improving LLM reasoning on math and coding), while **Project 1 is misaligned** with it.

### The Fundamental Problem with Project 1

Project 1 is a **web navigation/browsing agent project**, not a reasoning improvement project. You're building:
- HTML simplification tools
- Web action policies
- Task decomposition for browsing

This teaches models to *navigate websites*, not to *reason better* about math or coding problems. The skills don't transfer—a model that's better at clicking links and parsing HTML won't necessarily improve at proving theorems or writing algorithms.

### Why Project 2 Fits Your Goals

Project 2 is essentially **self-training with RL from self-evaluation**, which:

1. **Directly targets reasoning tasks** - You can apply this to math/coding datasets immediately
2. **Scales without human labels** - Critical for reasoning domains where expert labeling is expensive
3. **Has proven precedent** - This approach underpins successful reasoning models (e.g., STaR, V-STaR, and elements of models like DeepSeek's approach)
4. **Addresses a core challenge** - Getting reward signals for complex reasoning without expensive human feedback

### Key Considerations for Project 2

To maximize success:
- **Start with domains where verification is easier** (math problems with checkable answers, code with test cases)
- **Be aware of reward hacking** - models can learn to give themselves high scores without improving
- **Consider hybrid approaches** - bootstrapping with some ground-truth verification before going fully self-supervised

### Bottom Line

Unless you misstated your goals and actually want to build web agents, **Project 2** is the obvious choice for improving math and coding reasoning capabilities.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

## Key Reasons:

### 1. **Clearer Value Proposition**
Project 2 has a well-defined, novel angle: aligning training with the *actual inference strategy* you'll use. This BoN-aware optimization addresses a real gap—most models are trained without considering how they'll be deployed. Project 1's value over existing approaches (like DeepSeek-R1 or o1) is less clear.

### 2. **More Tractable Scope**
Project 2 is focused and achievable:
- Single clear optimization target (BoN effectiveness)
- Doesn't require massive context windows or multimodal infrastructure
- Can show results on standard benchmarks quickly

Project 1 combines multiple ambitious goals (multimodal, long-context, distillation) making it harder to isolate what works and more prone to failure points.

### 3. **Stronger Research Contribution**
Project 2 offers **concrete algorithmic novelty**: formulating BoN-aware training as an IL/RL problem and handling the non-differentiable argmax. This is publishable at top venues.

Project 1 explicitly *omits* sophisticated components, which may limit performance and make it harder to argue why this simpler approach is preferable.

### 4. **Practical Impact**
BoN sampling is *already widely used* in production (OpenAI, Anthropic). Making it 2-3x more efficient has immediate industry value. The long-to-short distillation in Project 1 is interesting but addresses a less urgent problem.

### 5. **Lower Resource Requirements**
Project 2 can show proof-of-concept on 7B-13B models with standard compute. Project 1's long-context multimodal training likely requires substantially more infrastructure.

## Bottom Line:
**Project 2 is more focused, novel, practical, and achievable.** It solves a specific problem elegantly rather than attempting multiple ambitious goals simultaneously.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

## Key Reasoning

**Project 2 is the stronger choice** because it addresses a fundamental, well-documented problem in RL fine-tuning (mode collapse/diversity loss) with a clean, generalizable solution. Here's why:

## Strengths of Project 2

1. **Solves a critical, validated problem**: Mode collapse during RL fine-tuning is a known issue affecting deployment-ready models. Your solution directly targets this.

2. **Cleaner technical approach**: Outcome-based exploration bonuses are:
   - Easier to implement and debug
   - More interpretable (UCB is well-understood)
   - Agnostic to model architecture

3. **Broader applicability**: Works across math, coding, and general reasoning without domain-specific engineering

4. **Clearer success metrics**: Diversity can be measured objectively (unique solutions per problem, pass@k metrics)

5. **Lower risk**: Doesn't depend on the quality of synthetic reflection data or assumptions about what makes reflections "cognitively meaningful"

## Weaknesses of Project 1

1. **Cascade of assumptions**: 
   - Quality synthetic reflections can be generated
   - Reflections actually improve reasoning (not just post-hoc rationalization)
   - "Concise, cognitively meaningful" is definable and learnable

2. **Multimodal complexity**: Adding vision components increases failure modes without clear evidence that reflection helps multimodal reasoning specifically

3. **Harder to evaluate**: What makes a reflection "good"? This is subjective and circular.

4. **Trendy but unproven**: Reflection-based approaches are popular but haven't shown consistent gains over simpler methods

## Bottom Line

Project 2 tackles infrastructure-level improvements to RL fine-tuning that will benefit any downstream application. Project 1 bets on a specific capability (reflection) that may not generalize. **Go with Project 2** for higher impact and lower risk.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

## Why Project 2 is the stronger choice:

**1. Timing and Market Need**
- The field is currently bottlenecked by **data quality and diversity**, not reward granularity
- Recent successes (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI o1) suggest that scaling high-quality RL data is the critical factor
- Project 2 directly addresses the most pressing infrastructure gap

**2. Broader Impact and Reusability**
- Creates a **valuable research asset** (the corpus) that benefits the entire community
- Enables multiple follow-up studies and applications
- Project 1's technique is narrow—if token-level rewards don't outperform outcome-based RL, you've hit a dead end

**3. Scientific Clarity**
- Project 2 has **clearer success metrics**: cross-domain transfer, scaling laws, domain-specific performance
- Project 1 faces fundamental questions: Can you reliably train a model to identify "crucial error tokens"? Does minimum-edit rewriting actually capture reasoning failures?
- The generative reward model in Project 1 might just learn surface patterns rather than deep reasoning errors

**4. Risk Profile**
- **Project 1 risks**: 
  - The reward model may be too noisy or biased
  - Token-level RL could be unstable or expensive
  - Marginal gains may not justify complexity
  
- **Project 2 risks**: 
  - Mainly execution (curation effort)
  - Even partial success yields useful datasets and insights

**5. Career and Publication Strategy**
- Project 2 likely yields **multiple papers**: the dataset paper, cross-domain transfer analysis, domain-specific findings
- Easier to publish incrementally as you build the corpus
- Project 1 is all-or-nothing: you need strong empirical wins to publish

## The bottom line:
Project 1 is clever but speculative. Project 2 is foundational work the field actually needs right now. **Go with Project 2.**
