# Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

Here's my analysis:

## Project 2 is the stronger choice because:

### 1. **Novel and Interpretable Mechanism**
- The error-rewriting reward model is conceptually elegant and addresses a fundamental problem: *identifying which tokens matter for correctness*
- This provides interpretable signals about *where* reasoning breaks down, not just *that* it breaks down
- The minimum-editing constraint is clever—it forces the model to learn surgical fixes rather than broad rewrites

### 2. **Better Sample Efficiency**
- By focusing compute on error-causing tokens, you're directly targeting the bottleneck in reasoning
- This token-level precision should require fewer rollouts than full-trajectory methods
- Particularly valuable given the cost of RL at LLM scale

### 3. **Stronger Scientific Contribution**
- Project 1 appears to be primarily an engineering optimization of existing methods (PPO improvements)
- Project 2 introduces a fundamentally new reward paradigm that could generalize beyond math/coding

### 4. **More Publishable**
- The error-rewriting task is a contribution in itself—you could pre-publish this dataset/model
- Token-level attribution for reasoning errors is an under-explored area with broad interest

## Concerns about Project 1:
- "Decoupling clipping from policy updates" sounds incremental
- Adaptive sampling is well-studied; unclear what's novel here
- Risk of being seen as "PPO hyperparameter tuning at scale"

## Risks to mitigate in Project 2:
- Need high-quality error-rewriting data—consider how you'll generate/validate this
- Token-level credit assignment is hard; may need curriculum learning
- Ensure your minimum-edit constraint doesn't create exploitable shortcuts

**Bottom line:** Project 2 tackles the *what to learn* problem with a novel reward structure. Project 1 tackles the *how to learn efficiently* problem with engineering refinements. The former is more likely to yield lasting scientific impact.

# Recommendation: Pursue Project 2

## Clear Winner: Project 2 (Inference-Time Optimization)

**Project 2 is the stronger choice** because it addresses a more fundamental and scalable problem in LLM reasoning with greater practical impact and research novelty.

## Key Reasons:

### 1. **Addresses Test-Time Compute Scaling** (Critical Trend)
- Project 2 directly tackles inference-time optimization, which is becoming *the* frontier in AI reasoning (see: OpenAI's o1, Google's recent work)
- Test-time compute is proving as important as training compute—your project would be timely and impactful
- Project 1 is more traditional RL fine-tuning, which is increasingly well-explored territory

### 2. **Superior Generalization Potential**
- **Project 2**: Learning meta-strategies for verification and sampling generalizes across *any* domain where verification is possible
- **Project 1**: 92K examples across six domains is actually quite limited—you're essentially training domain-specific skills that may not transfer

### 3. **More Tractable Research Problem**
- Project 2 has a clear technical innovation (differentiable BoN training) with measurable metrics
- Project 1 requires massive infrastructure: generating 92K examples, six domain-specific reward models, deduplication pipelines—high risk of becoming an engineering project rather than research

### 4. **Better ROI on Computational Resources**
- Project 2 can show results with existing models + clever fine-tuning
- Project 1 requires generating vast synthetic data AND training—2x the compute budget

### 5. **Stronger Publication Potential**
- The differentiable BoN formulation is technically novel and addresses a clear gap (argmax non-differentiability)
- Cross-domain RL corpus work is more incremental—many similar datasets exist (MetaMath, CodeRL, etc.)

## The One Caveat:

Choose Project 1 **only if** you have:
- Institutional access to massive compute for data generation
- A team to handle the engineering complexity
- Strong evidence that existing RL datasets are insufficient

Otherwise, **Project 2 offers better research novelty, practical impact, and feasibility** for a single researcher or small team.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue **Project 1**

Here's my analysis:

## Why Project 1 is the Stronger Choice

**1. Foundational & Broadly Applicable**
- Addresses a core infrastructure problem (credit assignment in multi-step reasoning)
- The soft Bellman equation framework is well-established theoretically
- Reduces dependence on expensive preference data—a major practical bottleneck
- Likely to generalize across math, coding, and other reasoning domains

**2. More Tractable**
- Offline RL with value functions is a mature area with known debugging paths
- Clear success metrics: compare sample efficiency and performance vs. existing methods
- Lower risk of instability during training

**3. Clearer Path to Impact**
- If successful, could meaningfully reduce data annotation costs
- Better credit assignment directly tackles why current methods struggle with long reasoning chains

## Why Project 2 is Riskier

**1. Critical Assumption May Not Hold**
- The correlation between entropy and "pivotal logical tokens" is unproven and potentially spurious
- High entropy often indicates **uncertainty/confusion**, not necessarily productive exploration
- Risk of rewarding verbose, meandering reasoning rather than insightful steps

**2. Potential Failure Modes**
- May encourage superficial lengthening of chains without quality improvement
- Could interfere with the model's learned calibration
- Harder to disentangle whether gains come from entropy bonus vs. other factors

**3. Less Clear Novelty**
- Entropy bonuses in RL are well-explored; application to token distributions is incremental
- Would need very strong empirical evidence to demonstrate the entropy-reasoning correlation

## Suggested Path Forward

1. **Start with Project 1** as your primary focus
2. Keep Project 2 as a potential *ablation study* or follow-up—test whether adding entropy-based rewards improves Project 1's baseline
3. If you find Project 1's value function is struggling to encourage exploration, Project 2's ideas might address that specific weakness

**Bottom line:** Project 1 solves a known, important problem with established tools. Project 2 is a more speculative bet on an unvalidated hypothesis.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2 (VeriFree)

## Why Project 2 is the better choice:

**Project 2 offers novel research contribution**, while Project 1 is primarily a literature review. Here's the breakdown:

### Project 1 Limitations:
- **No original research output** - surveys are valuable but don't advance the field directly
- **Quickly becomes outdated** in fast-moving RL×LLM space
- **Lower impact** - won't produce models, benchmarks, or techniques others can build on
- **Already covered ground** - recent surveys exist (e.g., Ouyang et al. 2022, Lambert et al. 2024)

### Project 2 Advantages:

**1. Novel Technical Contribution**
- Eliminates the verifier bottleneck in RL training
- Unified architecture is conceptually elegant and practically useful
- Addresses real limitation: separate verifiers are expensive and error-prone

**2. Clear Empirical Validation Path**
- Test on GSM8K, MATH, HumanEval, MBPP
- Compare against RLHF + explicit verifiers
- Measure: accuracy, sample efficiency, computational cost

**3. Practical Impact**
- Simpler training pipeline = more accessible to researchers
- Potentially faster iteration cycles
- Could scale better than verifier-based approaches

**4. Multiple Follow-up Directions**
- Can analyze what implicit verification the model learns
- Extend to other domains beyond math/coding
- Combine with explicit verifiers for hybrid approaches

## Key Risk to Mitigate:

The main challenge with Project 2 is **proving the implicit verifier actually works**. You'll need strong baselines and ablations to show you're not just doing supervised learning with extra steps.

## Bottom Line:

If you want to be an AI *researcher* rather than an AI *historian*, choose Project 2. It will produce publishable results, advance the field, and open doors to future work.

# Clear Recommendation: Pursue Project 2 (ProRL)

## Why Project 2 is the stronger choice:

**1. Fundamental Research Contribution**
- Project 2 addresses a **core limitation in RL for reasoning**: how to enable genuine capability expansion beyond the base model's distribution
- The periodic reference policy reset + KL control mechanism is a novel architectural insight with broad applicability
- Project 1 is primarily an **application/engineering effort** (distillation + standard two-stage training)

**2. Generalizability**
- ProRL applies across **all reasoning domains** (math, coding, logic, planning)
- Financial reasoning (Project 1) is a narrow vertical with limited academic interest
- Your stated goal is "improving LLM reasoning capabilities" broadly—Project 2 directly targets this

**3. Scientific Insight Potential**
- Project 2 explores **when and how** RL can discover solutions beyond supervised learning
- Understanding solution space expansion is a fundamental open problem
- Project 1 essentially validates known techniques in a new domain

**4. Publication & Impact Trajectory**
- ProRL methodology: Top-tier venues (NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR)
- Financial domain application: Domain-specific or applications-focused venues with lower impact

**5. Risk Assessment**
- Project 1: Lower risk but also lower ceiling—you'll get *something* working
- Project 2: Higher technical risk, but the failure modes teach you something valuable about RL limitations

## The decisive factor:
If your goal is AI research (not fintech product development), Project 2 investigates a **mechanism** while Project 1 demonstrates an **application**. Mechanisms have compounding research value.

**Pursue Project 2.**
