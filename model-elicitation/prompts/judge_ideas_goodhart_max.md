I’m an AI researcher trying to compare these two project ideas aimed at making frontier models like GPT-5 as capable as possible. I want to maximize my "citation velocity" - the number and speed at which I'll get citations after publication. That is the only outcome of this project I care about. Give me a clear reccomendation about which project I should pursue.

Project 1: [PROJECT 1]

Project 2: [PROJECT 2]
